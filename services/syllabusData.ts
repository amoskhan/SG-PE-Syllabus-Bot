PHYSICAL EDUCATION TEACHING & LEARNING SYLLABUS
Primary, Secondary & Pre-University
Implementation starting in: 2024 for Primary Level, 2025 for Secondary and Pre-University Levels

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Curriculum Framework
Physical Education is an integral component of Singapore’s school curriculum to develop students holistically. By emphasising the importance of movement, and an individual’s interaction with the environment, Physical Education seeks to develop the whole child to bring about a nation of physically competent and confident individuals who enjoy a lifetime of active and healthy living safely and responsibly.

The three learning areas of Physical Activity, Outdoor Education, and Physical Health and Safety are pivotal in providing the content for design and enactment of students’ meaningful learning experiences in, about and through movement.

PHILOSOPHICAL UNDERPINNINGS
The Physical Education syllabus is underpinned by the belief that movement is fundamental and essential to life, work and play. All individuals have the capacity to capitalise on their movement potential to lead productive and fulfilling lives.

BIG IDEAS
Physical Education uses movement and the environment to develop the whole child.
Movement:
- Learning in Movement: Developing movement competencies and appreciating inherent values/joy.
- Learning about Movement: Pursuing knowledge/understanding about movement (body awareness, health, fitness).
- Learning through Movement: Developing desirable personal and social attributes (character, social-emotional competencies).

Interaction with Environment:
- Physical Environment: Physical structures, natural world, sports facilities.
- Social Environment: Friends, teachers, parents, community partners.

PURPOSE AND GOALS
The purpose of Physical Education is to develop physically competent and confident individuals who enjoy a lifetime of active and healthy living safely and responsibly.

The five goals:
1. Movement Competence: Competent and confident to participate in a range of physical and outdoor activities.
2. Healthy Lifestyle Practices: Personal commitment to healthy lifestyle practices in physical activity, nutrition, sleep, outdoor time and hygiene.
