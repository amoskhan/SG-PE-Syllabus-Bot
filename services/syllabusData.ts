Physical Education and Sports Development Framework

The Physical Education and Sports Development Framework guides the delivery of Physical Education and sports within the school system. It envisions a nation of active, healthy and physically competent individuals. Everyone values, participates, and pursues physical activities, including outdoor activities and sports of their interest and ability, in order to enrich their lives, be they for recreation and well-being, personal challenge and achievement, or for national honours.

Fundamental motor skills and core values provide a strong foundation for the learning, safe participation and enjoyment of a wide variety of physical activities. With a broad-based development of physical competencies, everyone is able to continue participating at a recreational level. Those with the interest and ability to participate at a higher level will be able to specialise and commit to sport-specific training. Individuals who demonstrate talent can then invest their time and effort in training for high performance with the national sports organisations.

The physical ability and interest of each person may change across the life span. With a broad range of physical competencies, each individual is enabled at any level of participation to choose and switch to the physical activities and sports preferred. These individuals are able to continue their participation recreationally or competitively, thus motivating them towards lifelong participation.

The school’s Physical Education curriculum is a primary contributor to building a strong foundation for the development of broad-based physical competencies and opportunities for recreational participation. Building upon the Physical Education curriculum, the Physical Sports Co-curricular Activities (CCA) programme provides opportunities for specialisation in a sport, as well as broad-based development within the specialised sport and across other sports. Together with other school programmes, Physical Education, Outdoor Education, and Physical Sports CCA contribute to holistic education and the development of 21st Century Competencies to better prepare each individual to thrive in a fast-changing and highly connected world.

(Figure 1. Physical Education and Sports Development Framework - Description) The framework consists of a pyramid structure:

Active and Healthy Living (Top Goal): Sustained involvement in physical activities and sports, including outdoor pursuit based on interest and competencies; Application of principles of training and safe practices; Maintenance of health and skill-related fitness.

High Performance Sports Pursuit: Consolidation of specific skills and tactics in one or two sports; High amount of performance-based training; Focus on one sport; Application of training in competitions; Development of mental skills.

Recreational Participation: Broad-Based Development; Acquisition of a range of physical skills and concepts; Emphasis on application in developmentally appropriate physical activities; Involvement in fun and inclusive experiences.

Strong Foundation (Base): Acquisition of fundamental movement skills and concepts, outdoor competencies, and health practices; Emphasis on learning & enjoyment; Anchored on core values (respect, responsibility, resilience, integrity, care & harmony).

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Curriculum Framework
OVERVIEW Physical Education is an integral component of Singapore’s school curriculum to develop students holistically. By emphasising the importance of movement, and an individual’s interaction with the environment, Physical Education seeks to develop the whole child to bring about a nation of physically competent and confident individuals who enjoy a lifetime of active and healthy living safely and responsibly.

The three learning areas of Physical Activity, Outdoor Education, and Physical Health and Safety are pivotal in providing the content for design and enactment of students’ meaningful learning experiences in, about and through movement. These areas leverage the physical and social environment to provide real-life contexts that strengthen students’ learning. A balanced and well-designed Physical Education curriculum, delivered through effective pedagogies and purposeful assessment can enable students to apply the skills, knowledge, practices and values to lead an active and healthy lifestyle. Additionally, it can help them acquire the 21st century competencies to thrive in the fast changing and complex world.

PHILOSOPHICAL UNDERPINNINGS The Physical Education syllabus is underpinned by the belief that movement is fundamental and essential to life, work and play. All individuals have the capacity to capitalise on their movement potential to lead productive and fulfilling lives. Developing movement competence is an integral part of an individual’s holistic education. It facilitates participation in physical activities through which the individual discovers the joy of movement, learns about themselves and their bodies, and develops the physical, cognitive and affective competencies that will contribute to their lifelong well-being.

The premise of a healthy lifestyle includes regular physical activity participation. It is essential for healthy growth and development in children and adolescents and is associated with lifelong health benefits and quality of life. Regular participation in a range of physical activities and intensity levels is necessary to achieve substantive health benefits. An individual’s development and lifestyle behaviours are shaped by their interactions with the environment. Therefore, meaningful and authentic learning experiences in school prepare the individual to contribute to the community and adapt to different life contexts. The Physical Education syllabus recognises the importance of providing students with real-life contexts that strengthen their learning and enable them to apply the skills, knowledge, practices and values to lead an active and healthy lifestyle.

BIG IDEAS Physical Education uses movement and the environment to develop the whole child.

Movement. Movement is fundamental to Physical Education. It is used as a means to facilitate students’ holistic development through the three interconnected dimensions:

Learning in Movement. It involves developing movement competencies and appreciating the inherent values and joy of movement experiences. Successful participation in physical activities requires the acquisition and mastery of appropriate fundamental and specialised skills. Through thoughtful participation in the carefully selected physical activities, students acquire a range of movement skills and concepts to move with competence and confidence across a wide variety of settings. With regular and varied movement experiences, students become consciously aware of and appreciate the inherent values and joy of movement experiences. This enables students to enjoy being active, discover and deepen their interests in physical activity, and thus, motivates them towards lifelong participation.

Learning about Movement. It involves pursuing knowledge and understanding about movement. With the use of physical activities to underpin learning, students develop an understanding of their body, how it moves and how to improve their movement. Students learn how to develop and improve their health and fitness safely. This enables students to apply their knowledge and understanding to improve their movement for regular and safe participation and performance across a range of physical activities.

Learning through Movement. It involves leveraging movement experiences as a means to develop desirable personal and social attributes among students. Participation in different activities of varied physical and social settings enables students to achieve other educational and health outcomes such as character, social-emotional competencies, fitness and mental well-being. These outcomes can be developed as students work individually or in teams while participating in physical activities. This enables students to apply their learning to new and challenging real-life situations.

Interaction with Environment. The environment plays a crucial role in shaping and reinforcing movement competence and lifestyle behaviours. Physical Education leverages the interactions of an individual with the physical and social environments to strengthen students’ learning and desired behaviours.

Physical Environment. It includes the physical structures and the natural world around people. They could be the physical space and facilities within the school and community such as sports facilities for physical activities, as well as supermarkets and canteens for learning about healthier food options. In addition, the use of nature and outdoor spaces promotes physical activities and enables students to develop a sense of connectedness towards the place, contributing to positive outcomes such as well-being and environmentally sustainable practices. As students are exposed to different learning contexts, they learn new skills and develop competencies in interacting with the varied physical environments in school and beyond.

Social Environment. It includes the immediate social setting which includes friends, teachers, family members and other people with whom individuals interact. Movement experiences can take place in individual or group contexts.

Friends and schoolmates provide a supportive environment for students to co-construct knowledge and build positive relationships through cooperating and collaborating in group tasks.

Teachers are important role models who ensure a physically and emotionally safe learning environment and use effective pedagogical and purposeful assessment strategies to facilitate students in finding the joy in movement, making connections and applying their learning.

Parents and primary caregivers are crucial to reinforce and connect students’ learning at home and in the community by encouraging or modelling physically active and healthy choices with their children.

Community partners provide the expertise and resources to support students’ transfer of learning and promote active and healthy living beyond the school.

Learning in Physical Education is most authentic and effective when it occurs within the context of an active and healthy school with parental involvement. This approach ensures that students learn about active and healthy living in an environment that reinforces their learning. It provides consistent messaging to students to establish and strengthen their individual and collective healthy lifestyle behaviours. Therefore, in designing the school’s Physical Education curriculum, the broader socio-ecological contexts of the school and parents are to be considered.

Through Physical Education, students engage in movement experiences in diverse physical and social environments that promote the development of physical, social and affective competencies. As the students interact with others in authentic settings, they construct knowledge and skills, making personal meaning of what they are learning. This fosters greater ownership, and self-directed learning and behaviour. Through these dynamic interactions, the individual also learns to think, feel and act in consideration of the physical environment and the others who make up the social environment.

PURPOSE AND GOALS The purpose of Physical Education is to develop physically competent and confident individuals who enjoy a lifetime of active and healthy living safely and responsibly. The five goals below serve as a guide for the above purpose. Each goal is equally important, and they interact with one another in a well-planned Physical Education curriculum that addresses the understanding, skills, practices and values desired for every student.

Movement Competence. Students are competent and confident to participate in a range of physical and outdoor activities. Students acquire the skills and knowledge in a variety of physical activities to develop their personal level of movement competence. They apply their skills and knowledge to participate individually and with others in physical activities for recreation, health, and personal challenge and achievement. They understand the movement concepts and are able to transfer these skills and knowledge across different physical activities and environment.

Healthy Lifestyle Practices. Students have a personal commitment to healthy lifestyle practices in physical activity, nutrition, sleep, outdoor time and hygiene. Students believe in the importance and benefits of an active and healthy lifestyle. They understand the individual and environmental factors that contribute to their lifestyle choices and are able to apply the health knowledge and skills in their daily living across different life contexts. They develop a sense of personal responsibility for their health and are able to make informed decisions to live it out, contributing to their holistic well-being.

Safety Mindset. Students apply risk assessment to manage daily and physical activities with respect to self, others and the environment. Students demonstrate safe practices and take responsibility of their own safety as well as the safety of others around them. They are cognisant of their own ability and the environment, and are able to identify hazards, assess and manage risks, and respond to emergency situations. They possess a safety mindset with a keen spirit of adventure and have the ability to take responsible risks.

Core Values. Students make informed and responsible decisions with regard to personal behaviour and social interactions based on sound values-based judgements. Students’ behaviours are reflective of the core values such as the following:

respect and care for self, others and the environment

integrity (sportsmanship) and harmony (teamwork) in the participation of physical activities

resilience through adopting a positive outlook when faced with challenges and giving their best effort

responsibility in the areas of personal health, fitness, hygiene and safety

Enjoyment. Students enjoy and value physical activities and healthy living in a sustainable way. Students appreciate the inherent values and joy of movement experiences. They exhibit a positive self-concept through participating in a wide range of physical activities. They are able to appreciate the outdoors, actively engage with places meaningfully and take actions to contribute to a sustainable community.

In pursuing a lifetime of active and healthy living, students demonstrate the following:

engage in physical activities of interest regularly and limit sedentary time

spend time outdoors and enjoy nature responsibly

have a balanced diet and often choose healthier options

rest and sleep sufficiently

practise personal hygiene

1.2 Syllabus Design
KEY ATTRIBUTES OF STUDENTS AT EACH EDUCATIONAL LEVEL The goals are further clarified and presented as key attributes of students at the end of each education level. The key attributes are as follows:

Primary level: Competent Participants who demonstrate efficiency, effectiveness and versatility in movement competencies. They enjoy participating in a range of physical activities including the outdoors, and engage in healthy practices.

Efficiency relates to the learning and mastery of different mature fundamental motor patterns (a.k.a. skills) and the ability to perform the components of each movement pattern correctly, either in isolation or in combination with other skills.

Effectiveness deals with the consistent and successful attainment of the performance intended outcomes, in relation to the different movement concept categories of space, effort and relationship.

Versatility refers to the ability to demonstrate skilled performance across a wide variety of movement contexts, environment and applications.

Secondary level: Confident Participants who demonstrate positive self-efficacy and value the need for sustainability in an active and healthy lifestyle.

Self-efficacy relates to one’s belief in their abilities to successfully apply skills, knowledge and practices and bring about expected results in personally valued movement and health endeavours.

Sustainability refers to the continued effort to learn and participate in recreational physical activities, as well as demonstrate and strengthen their health-enhancing practices over the course of one’s life.

Pre-University level: Committed Participants who demonstrate a conscious decision and action to pursue personal excellence; and are role models to their family and friends in leading an active and healthy lifestyle.

Personal excellence demonstrates the quality of one’s dedication to improve personal ability and performance against a set of self-established standards in physical activities.

Role model refers to the passionate individual who influences their family and friends by exemplifying the pursuit of active and healthy lifestyle.

Even though many of these attributes are psychomotor in nature, the vision is grounded in the core values and attitudes. As students learn, they must also develop the values and attitudes that will help provide them with clarity and a right sense of purpose as they seek to pursue a lifetime of active and healthy living.

LEARNING AREAS Three learning areas (Physical Activity, Outdoor Education, and Physical Health and Safety) and their learning outcomes are designed to enable students to develop the key attributes and attain the goals of Physical Education. Each learning area and learning outcome are important and they collectively contribute to the goals of Physical Education.

Physical Activity The content areas at the primary level are organised under Athletics, Dance, Games and Sports, Gymnastics and Swimming. Through these areas, students learn the fundamental movement skills incorporating the movement concepts. They develop efficiency, effectiveness and versatility in their performance as they practise and transfer their skills and concepts, individually and with others, across the different content areas. Building on these fundamental movement skills and concepts, students at the secondary level learn the specific skills and concepts of at least 5 physical activities, which enhance their movement competence and build the confidence to sustain their participation post-secondary. At pre-university level, students continue to expand and deepen their learning, and enjoy physical activities.

Outdoor Education The content is organised by themes with a place-responsive pedagogical focus and consists of three strands, namely: (a) outdoor living, (b) sense of place, and (c) risk assessment and management. At primary level, students learn about and connect with places and its inhabitants through direct experiences. They combine different movement skills and optimise the use of their senses while exploring outdoor places responsibly and safely. They also develop trip planning skills and are exposed to new and less familiar environments. At secondary level, students deepen their understanding and mastery of their technical competencies in the areas of navigation, shelter building, outdoor cooking, and trip planning. They learn to make good judgement in pre-emptive planning and application of risk assessment and management during dynamic situations in the outdoors. With repeated exposures and practice across the education levels, students develop personal connections with the places around them and a desire to contribute to a sustainable community. Students apply their outdoor competencies (i.e., knowledge, skills, and attitudes) during the culminating tasks such as day trips and cohort camps where self-directed learning experiences develop their spirit of adventure, resilience, and deepen personal connections with the environment.

Physical Health and Safety The content areas are organised under the following four strands, namely: (a) physical fitness, (b) nutrition, (c) safety and risk management, and (d) personal hygiene and self-care. Students develop an understanding of physical health concepts, active living, safe practices and personal hygiene. With the understanding, students apply the skills and knowledge to participate in physical activities regularly and safely, make healthier food choices and take care of themselves, thus developing a sense of personal responsibility towards active and healthy living. Students make connections between what they have learnt in class and their environment to exhibit health-enhancing behaviours. The varied and increasingly complex contexts provided across the education levels enable students to expand and deepen their skills, knowledge and practices in leading an active and healthy lifestyle. Some of the content such as safety and physical fitness are taught and reinforced in more than one learning area. This provides the opportunities for students to apply what they have learnt in different contexts. By highlighting the connections and integration across the learning areas, students gain a deeper understanding and mastery of the content within Physical Education.

APPLICATION OF LEARNING IN AUTHENTIC CONTEXT To consolidate and further make meaning of their learning, all students will experience a range of culminating events/activities across the educational levels. They are as follows:

Primary Level

at least 2 recreational competitions or performances by the end of Primary 6

a day trip in the school’s neighbourhood by the end of Primary 4

a 3-Day 2-Night outdoor adventure learning cohort camp by the end of Primary 5

work on a health practice for personal improvement in each year from Primary 3 to 6

Secondary Level

at least 3 recreational competitions by the end of Secondary 4/5

a 4-Day 3-Night outdoor adventure learning cohort camp by the end of Secondary 1

a 5-Day 4-Night outdoor adventure learning cohort camp by the end of Secondary 3

develop and enact an exercise plan to achieve a personal goal for physical health in Secondary 2

develop and enact an action plan to form a health practice(s) towards healthier behaviour(s) in Secondary 4

Pre-University Level

at least 1 recreational competition by the end of Pre-University 2/3

develop and enact an action plan for self or others to work towards a healthier lifestyle by the end of Pre-University 2/3

PEDAGOGICAL AND ASSESSMENT APPROACHES The Singapore Curriculum Philosophy and Singapore Teaching Practice guide the beliefs and processes of learning, teaching and assessment in Physical Education. The teaching of Physical Education primarily adopts an applied learning instructional approach that creates conditions for students to apply and draw personal connections between skills and concepts taught in the lessons to authentic contexts to deepen their learning and motivation; and supports the development of social emotional competencies and values in students. Contextualised to the discipline of Physical Education, the features listed below are key considerations to lesson design and enactment across the various learning areas.

Experience: Provide rich opportunities for students to explore, apply and practise their skills and knowledge in varied activities in authentic contexts.

Collaboration: Enable students to work together to co-construct, build on, and apply their skills and knowledge for collective improvement and making personal sense of learning.

Inquiry: Facilitate critical thinking and reflection to develop in students the ability to evaluate skills and knowledge that influence decision-making and action.

Integration: Teach and reinforce content across different topics and learning areas for transferability of skills and knowledge, thus facilitating students’ understanding of the inter-connection of content and application in different contexts, while building strong fundamentals.

Differentiation: Accommodate the students’ diverse learning needs and pace of learning to better engage them in meaningful ways.

Assessment forms an integral part of teaching and learning in Physical Education to provide information for making informed judgement about what students know and are able to do in order to help them progress towards attaining the goals of Physical Education. Students play an important role in assessment where they reflect on and monitor their learning progress. Aligned with the syllabus intent, Physical Education teachers anchor their teaching and learning beliefs on the big ideas and purpose of Physical Education to implement the syllabus thoughtfully. Through a well-balanced school-based curriculum that is aligned to the goals and learning outcomes as articulated in the Physical Education syllabus, students are guided to work towards achieving the purpose of Physical Education.

1.3 Desired Outcomes of Education and 21st Century Competencies
THE OUTCOMES The Desired Outcomes of Education (DOE) are attributes that educators aspire for every Singaporean to possess after completing their formal education. These outcomes establish a common purpose for educators, drive our policies and programmes, and allow us to consider how well our education system is doing. A child schooled in the Singapore education system embodies the Desired Outcomes of Education. They should possess a good sense of self-awareness, a sound moral compass, and the dispositions, skills, and knowledge to take on the opportunities and challenges of the future. They should be:

Confident persons who have a zest for life, have a strong sense of right and wrong, are adaptable and resilient, know themselves, are discerning in judgement, think independently and critically, and communicate effectively.

Self-directed learners who take responsibility for their own learning, are curious, reflective, and persevering in the lifelong pursuit of learning, driven by their passion and purpose.

Active contributors who are empathetic and open-minded to collaborate effectively in teams, exercise initiative, have courage to take risks responsibly, are innovative, and strive for excellence.

Concerned citizens who are rooted to Singapore, have a strong civic consciousness, are responsible to their family, community and nation, and take active roles in improving the lives of others.

21ST CENTURY COMPETENCIES The Framework for 21st Century Competencies and Student Outcomes (“21CC Framework”) shows how Core Values, Social-Emotional Competencies, and Emerging 21st Century Competencies support the realisation of MOE’s Desired Outcomes of Education.

As values form the core of one’s character, they are positioned at the centre of the framework. Social-Emotional Competencies, shown as an inner ring around the Core Values are necessary for students to enact their values purposefully and demonstrate good character in all contexts of life. Building on a sound character foundation, the outer ring of Emerging 21st Century Competencies enable students to thrive in and beyond school while living, learning and working in rapidly changing, highly digitalised and interconnected environments. The development of Core Values, Social-Emotional Competencies, and Emerging 21st Century Competencies are complementary and mutually reinforce one another. Therefore, the holistic development of 21st Century Competences (21CC) involves intentional teaching and reinforcing of knowledge, skills, dispositions and values from the core and both rings collectively. They should be developed through the total curriculum, which includes all student learning experiences delivered within and outside the structured timetable. These values and competencies will help our students live out the Desired Outcomes of Education.

Physical Education plays an important role in the development of these student outcomes and competences. It anchors student learning on the six core values of Respect, Resilience, Responsibility, Integrity, Care and Harmony. The shaping of beliefs, attitudes and actions are then linked to the social-emotional competencies aligned to the Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) Curriculum Frame, as part of the Framework for 21st Century Competencies and Student Outcomes. Therefore, in this Physical Education syllabus, learning outcomes are identified for each core value, presented in the form of related social-emotional competencies (as CCE Developmental Milestones). The set of Developmental Milestones articulates possible indicators for character-building across the six stages of schooling – lower primary, middle primary, upper primary, lower secondary, upper secondary, and post-secondary. Students are provided learning opportunities to practise and apply the identified social-emotional competencies related to all six core values during Physical Education. Schools may also include other outcomes that are deemed consistent with the school’s mission and values.

The interactive and problem-solving nature of many physical activities also afford the opportunities for students to reinforce the emerging 21st century competencies (e.g., in the domains of Critical, Adaptive and Inventive Thinking as well as Communication, Collaboration and Information Skills) learnt within the total curriculum. For example, in physical activities such as dance and gymnastics, students tap on their creativity to interpret the stimuli or contexts and express themselves through movement. In addition, challenges such as the diverse tactical problems presented in sports and games, and outdoor adventure learning, provide the affordance for students to assess the situations, create solutions and adapt to the changing demands. To enjoy and complete team physical activities or group activities such as those in the outdoors, students are required to communicate information and ideas clearly, and collaborate effectively. As part of the total curriculum, Physical Education learning experiences enable our young to demonstrate their social emotional and emerging 21st century competencies whilst strengthening their core values. This empowers them to tap into the rich opportunities in the new digital age, while keeping a strong Singapore heartbeat.

2. PRIMARY LEVEL SYLLABUS CONTENT
2.1 Overview
KEY ATTRIBUTES OF STUDENTS AND LEARNING EXPERIENCES For students to achieve the goals of Physical Education, the journey starts at the primary level. Physical Education at the primary level seeks to develop Competent Participants who demonstrate foundational movement competencies, outdoor competencies and health-enhancing practices. Students acquire the competencies and practices through various learning experiences in Physical Activity, Outdoor Education, and Physical Health and Safety.

Students focus on developing different fundamental motor skills such as locomotor, non-locomotor and manipulative skills, incorporating movement concepts across different settings. Students demonstrate efficiency in the correct performance of discrete fundamental motor skills and in combination with other skills. Students refine their effectiveness in movement by being consistent and successful in their performance, in relation to the different movement concepts and settings. Concurrently, students’ versatility is developed as they practise and transfer these motor skills and movement concepts across the different content areas.

Through exploration and engaging with places in the outdoors, students develop their movement and outdoor competencies. They learn to optimise the use of their senses while navigating around places. They also learn to assess and manage risks for themselves and others when participating in outdoor activities in a controlled and familiar environment. At the upper primary level, students learn more about trip planning and are exposed to new and less familiar environments. Through these learning experiences over time, students develop deeper connections with places and demonstrate sustainable practices.

Besides the acquisition of movement and outdoor competencies, students are also provided with the opportunity to learn and develop healthy practices in areas such as personal hygiene, regular participation in physical activities and healthy eating. Students understand the importance of health-enhancing practices in areas such as physical activities, nutrition and sleep. They are equipped with the skills and knowledge to improve their health- and fitness-related components and capacity to choose healthier drinks and food. They participate in physical activities regularly, eat healthily and sleep sufficiently for growth and health. Students’ motivation to lead an active, healthy lifestyle strengthens with each positive interaction between learning and the social and physical environment. By the end of primary level, students develop into competent participants who enjoy physical activities due to a strong foundation in movement skills and concepts. They also have the foundational outdoor competencies, and health concepts and skills to engage in an active and healthy lifestyle. They look forward to the opportunity to learn a range of specific physical activities, deepen their outdoor competencies and strengthen their health-enhancing practices at the secondary level.

CONTENT ORGANISATION Learning Areas and Strands The learning experiences leading to the goals of Physical Education at the primary level are organised according to the three learning areas and content areas/strands as shown in Table 1.

(Table 1. Learning Area, Content Area and Strand at the Primary Level)

Physical Activity

Content Area: Athletics, Dance, Games and Sports, Gymnastics, Swimming

Strand: Movement Skills and Concepts, Safety Practices

Outdoor Education

Strand: Outdoor Living, Sense of Place, Risk Assessment and Management

Physical Health and Safety

Strand: Physical Fitness, Safety and Risk Management, Nutrition, Personal Hygiene and Self-Care

Most content areas for Physical Activity (i.e., Dance, Games and Sports, and Gymnastics), Outdoor Education, and Physical Health and Safety are introduced at Primary 1. For the other content areas under Physical Activity, Athletics is introduced at Primary 4 and Swimming is to be completed by Primary 6. A balanced participation in Athletics, Dance, Games and Sports, Gymnastics, Swimming and Outdoor Education, with Physical Health and Safety blended into the six areas, is essential to teach students the critical movement skills and concepts. These essential building blocks for developing movement competency provide the necessary movement vocabulary and experiences for learning and performance.

A sample allocation of curriculum time for each learning area by level is shown in Table 2.

(Table 2. Sample Allocation of Curriculum Time for each Learning Area by Level (Primary))

Pri 1 to 2: Physical Activity (~80%), Outdoor Education (~10%), Physical Health and Safety (~10%)

Pri 3 to 6: Physical Activity (~83%), Outdoor Education (~7%), Physical Health and Safety (~10%)

Learning Outcomes The developmentally appropriate Learning Outcomes (LOs) specify minimally what students should know and be able to do for all the learning areas by each specific level except for swimming which is to be completed by the end of the primary level. They serve to guide the development of unit and lesson planning, and the conduct of the lesson. The sequence of the LOs presented in each learning area is in no way prescribing a linear means of organising, ordering and delivering the content. For example, schools can plan to introduce the LOs for kicking before throwing for Primary 2.

Learning Outcomes
The developmentally appropriate Learning Outcomes (LOs) specify minimally what students
should know and be able to do for all the learning areas by each specific level except for
swimming which is to be completed by the end of the primary level. They serve to guide the
development of unit and lesson planning, and the conduct of the lesson.
The sequence of the LOs presented in each learning area is in no way prescribing a linear
means of organising, ordering and delivering the content. For example, schools can plan to
introduce the LOs for kicking before throwing for Primary 2. However, the LOs for specific
skills are generally organised sequentially from simple to complex based on the acquisition of
skill proficiency. For example, students should learn to kick a stationary ball while stationary
before proceeding onto kicking a stationary ball using a smooth running approach.
Some of the LOs can be achieved through 1 or 2 lessons (each at 30 minutes). However, not
all LOs are meant to be achieved within 1 to 2 lessons. These LOs can be achieved through a
sequence of lessons and distributed practice throughout the school year. Several skills can be
presented in one lesson and developed over several lessons. Adequate practice time needs
to be scheduled to allow students to achieve control and precision in their movements.

Application of Learning in Authentic Context
To consolidate and make meaning of their learning, students will experience the following
culminating events:
•
•
•
•

at least 2 recreational competitions or performances by the end of Primary 6
a day trip in the school’s neighbourhood by the end of Primary 4
a 3-Day 2-Night outdoor adventure learning cohort camp by the end of Primary 5
work on a health practice for personal improvement in each year from Primary 3 to 6

2.2 Learning Areas
Physical Activity
The Motor Skills and Concepts Framework2 underpins the Physical Activity learning area and
its content areas of Athletics, Dance, Games and Sports, Gymnastics and Swimming at the
primary level.

MOTOR SKILLS AND CONCEPTS FRAMEWORK
The Motor Skills and Concepts Framework identifies the three different categories of
fundamental motor skills and the four broad categories of movement concepts. This
framework helps teachers to design their school-based Physical Education curriculum to
promote students’ competence in a variety of locomotor, non-locomotor and manipulative
skills, but more importantly, to combine the skills and movement concepts with
developmentally appropriate content to enhance understanding, mastery and application of
movement skills. The three different categories of fundamental motor skills are in Table 3.
Locomotor Skills

Non-locomotor Skills

Manipulative Skills

walking, running, leaping,
jumping, hopping, skipping,
galloping, sliding, crawling,
rolling3/rotating4

curling, stretching, twisting, turning,
spinning, pushing, pulling, rocking,
swinging, pivoting, balancing, counterbalancing, counter-tension

rolling3, throwing, catching,
bouncing, dribbling,
trapping, kicking, volleying,
striking

Table 3. Category of Fundamental Motor Skills
Movement concepts describe what the body is doing pertaining to where the movement
action takes place, how the body moves, and whether the action is performed alone or with
others, with or without equipment. The concepts describe or modify the quality of the
movement, i.e., how a single skill, or combination of two or more skills, is to be performed
across a broad range of experiences.
Learning and applying movement concepts ensure that students can transfer the use of
quality movement to new and appropriate situations, which are characteristics of a student
being efficient, effective and versatile in movement. The four broad categories of movement
concepts are:
•
•
•
•

body awareness (what the body is doing)
space awareness (where the body and object are moving)
effort (how the body is moving)
relationships (with whom or what the body is relating to as it moves)

2 The framework is adapted primarily from the following sources: Abels & Bridges (2010, p.11), Gallahue & Donnelly (1993,

p. 388-389, 393); Graham et al. (1993, p.24); Logsdon et al. (1984, p.140).
3 Rolling appears twice as a locomotor roll-like action and a manipulative sending an object away action.
4 Rotating is used primarily in gymnastics to refer to action around all axis (e.g., log roll, forward roll)

GUIDELINES IN THE TEACHING OF MOVEMENT SKILLS AND CONCEPTS
In the teaching of a movement skill and related concept, the following guidelines are
recommended:
•
•
•
•

state the learning objective clearly without limiting students’ movement actions
(where possible)
define the movement skill and concept for the students (e.g., what is balance and how
are different body parts used?)
identify the teaching cues to help students perform the skill with quality (e.g., the
number of body parts and the size of the base of support determine the level of
stability)
provide students with many opportunities to use the movement skill and concept,
either in some specific ways (e.g., balance using one foot and one hand [see interactive
teaching in Section 3]) or in a more exploratory context (e.g., balance using different
number of body parts ranging from two to four body parts)

Students, generally, do not necessarily develop the proper way of moving (i.e., display the
mature pattern6), or understand how to move properly on their own simply by playing games.
Therefore, it is extremely important that the different fundamental motor skills and concepts
are introduced, and students are instructed on how to perform the components of the
movement patterns correctly starting from Primary 1 and reinforced continually throughout
the upper primary levels.

APPLICATION OF LEARNING IN AUTHENTIC CONTEXT
By the end of primary 6, students will experience at least 2 recreational competitions or
performances organised by the school at the inter-class level. The recreational competitions
and performances represent the cumulative events specific to the Physical Activity learning
area. They provide a platform for students to apply the skills and values learnt in an authentic
context. Its purpose is to enhance the learning experience by providing the opportunity for
students to participate in a safe competitive environment beyond their classes. It also
provides opportunity for students to develop their affective skills in a competitive social
setting provided by the recreational competition and performance atmosphere.

6 The mature pattern indicates the sequence in which components of the fundamental motor skill occur.

Athletics
The athletics component involves students primarily in running, jumping and throwing
activities that promote personal striving. Initial learning should focus on exploring the
fundamentals of walking, running, jumping, and throwing while progressively developing
and applying these movements into techniques in the later stages of learning. Students
participate in challenges that increase their personal performances by testing themselves
against fellow students, and also by meeting non-competitive contexts where the focus
remains on improving one’s personal best. Multiple learning contexts will be presented for
students to learn to be determined and resilient, as they develop their potential. These
opportunities encourage students to run faster and over different distances, jump higher
and further, and throw different objects with improving distances.

FOR USE BY EDUCATION OFFICERS ONLY

PROGRESSION
The basic actions of Athletics, which are running, jumping and throwing are acquired at
Primary 1 to 3 mainly through Dance, Games and Sports and Gymnastics. Athletics is taught
from Primary 4 onwards where the basic actions of running, jumping and throwing acquired
at Primary 1 to 3 are transferred and developed to more specialised skills. Through Athletics,
students challenge themselves to run faster and over longer distance, jump for height and
distance, and throw objects of different shapes and weight for distance and accuracy.

Dance
Dance develops in students an understanding of rhythmic movement. It also enables
students to express and communicate feelings and ideas through exploration, creation and
performance. The focus is on the use of body as instrument of communication and selfexpression, accompanied by various stimuli. Through a variety of learning experiences and
dance forms, the enjoyment and appreciation of the quality of movement can be achieved.
Opportunities for involvement in and enjoyment of different dances can promote harmony
and respect for cultural differences.

In learning to move through dance, students will progress through the following
developmental sequence incorporating an understanding of body, space, effort and
relationship awareness:
movement patterns →movement phrases → sequence of movement phrases →
structured dances
•
•
•
•

movement patterns (locomotor and non-locomotor movements)
movement phrases (a combination of movement patterns)
sequence of movement phrases (a combination of movement phrases in some order)
structured dances (pre-designed movement sequences)

In determining the lesson objectives from the LOs, teachers should design movement
activities to facilitate student learning in generally no more than two to three skills and
concepts simultaneously for initial learning. For example, young children can generally learn
to move in different ways in location/space, changing direction and at different time.
Teachers can reinforce previously learnt concepts during the introduction of other new
concepts. For example, young children can demonstrate a variety of locomotor movements
reflecting a mastery of the concepts of direction and time, while learning to incorporate the
new concept of pathway in their previous movements.

Games and Sports
Games and Sports promote the students’ playful tendency to control objects and the body
during the early stages of learning. Early movement experiences, practised individually and
in cooperative relationships with others, help develop competency and confidence in
critical elements of discrete motor skills that progressively lead toward mature patterns.
Skills practised in combination with and incorporating movement concepts are essential
before application across a broad range of formalised but simplified game-like activities.
Games-related concepts such as ‘using space’, ‘keeping possession’, ‘creating attack’,
‘delaying invasion’, ‘defending space’, ‘advancing bases’ are consciously weaved into
appropriate teacher-structured game situations, together with an emphasis on the learning
and demonstration of values like integrity, respect and resilience. A range of game play
experiences from territorial-invasion, net-barrier, striking-fielding, and other games
encourages students’ safe and maximal participation, with modification to game rules to
match and enhance their developing skills and understanding.

PROGRESSION
In Games and Sports, the basic fundamentals of manipulative skills are mainly taught from
Primary 1 to 3. Students learn the various movement patterns for each skill and how it can be
performed under the different movement concepts of space, effort and relationship
awareness. For example, after learning the movement pattern for dribbling, students learn to
dribble stationary followed by on the move and at different speed and pathways to avoid a
defender.
Practice is carried out in simple situations like stationary and on the move, without and with
a partner. Combination skills like catching and throwing an object, e.g., catching, dribbling
and throwing a ball to a teammate are taught from Primary 4. Students apply their skills in
more complex game-like situations such as catching and throwing an object while defended.
From Primary 5 onwards, games are organised in three games categories of net-barrier,
striking-fielding and territorial-invasion with the various games-related concepts (refer to
Table 2). Situational games 12 will be used to teach the students the games-related concepts
and the related skills (“How to do”). For example, in a 1v1 situational game in the territorialinvasion category, students will have to move away from the defender or protect the ball
(“What to do”). This is done by dribbling or shielding the ball (“How to do”). The “How to do”
segment are skills that students have learnt from Primary 1 to 4. Students get to reinforce
and apply the skills learnt in Primary 5 and 6. Quick decisions (‘What to do’) have to be made
by selecting the most appropriate movement as demanded by the context presented in the
situational game.

GAMES-RELATED CONCEPTS AND SKILLS
Games-related concepts13 are introduced to students through modified games. Both
fundamental and specialised skills and movement concepts are required in playing these
games. In this syllabus, games are classified into the following categories:
•
•
•

net-barrier
striking-fielding
territorial-invasion

Within each game category, there are games-related concepts that are transferrable from
game to game. Table 5 describes the main intention of the game and the games-related
concepts across the three games categories.

12 Situational game refers to the context of which a specific number of players from both teams are interacting in offence

and defence, with rules to the game played, and where players in the offence and defence have to decide what to do
specifically and to translate that decision into movement skills.

Table 5. Games-related Concepts and Skills
The design of the games and sport at the primary level, focuses on developing strong
foundational movement for individuals at the lower primary levels. This is then further honed
through the provision of increasing game complexity at the upper primary levels. With a firm
grounding in individual skills and increasing experience of games concepts through
socialisation in team games.
To provide students with a conclusion to the learning experience in games and sports, endstate games will be played at the end of each game category to provide students with a nonthreatening, performance-oriented learning experience at the class level. End-state games
are small-sided, intra-class games that are modified to provide the appropriate challengelevel based on students’ readiness. The end-state games in each game category should be
creatively designed by teachers to bear critical concepts of each game category. Table 6
highlights the number of players for each game category and the design considerations.

Safety Practices
•

Demonstrate safe use of equipment and apparatus to prevent placing self and others at risk.

Gymnastics
Gymnastics enhances overall body management and control through creative
interpretation of movement and sequence. The learning experience starts within the
boundaries of open-ended tasks, and progressively moves onto more stylised gymnastic
movements. The emphasis is on challenging students, working either alone or in pairs and
groups, to manoeuvre their bodies safely on the floor and when negotiating a variety of
apparatus. Focus is on students practising without much physical assistance by teachers.
Working with others and experiencing a sense of cooperative success in managing different
gymnastics problems facilitate the development of care, harmony, responsibility and
resilience.

DESIGN PRINCIPLES
The Gymnastics learning area is designed based on a continuum of principles as represented
in Figure 4 below.

Single-Dual Movement Sequence

Figure 4. Gymnastics Design Principles
Gymnastics provides opportunities for students to explore and refine various fundamental
body movements organised into four gymnastics movement categories. Given the varied
movement experience and ability of students, the focus is on providing individual challenge
and encouraging individual success in each of the movement category below.
•
•
•
•

Travelling, jumping and climbing actions
Balancing actions
Rotating actions
Mounting, dismounting and vaulting actions

When designing and implementing gymnastics lessons, teachers should note the following:
Technique
• All gymnastics movements should demonstrate good control and work towards good
form.
• Balancing actions should generally demonstrate momentary stillness.
Safety
• Safety should undergird all gymnastics lesson design, content and teaching.
• Students should be able to perform the skill independently, competently and
confidently before moving onto the next level of difficulty of the skill.
• Students should use assistance (e.g., apparatus-support, wall-support) until ready to
perform the gymnastics movement with control on their own.
• Students should learn how to move on and off apparatus, move into and out of
movements, safely and with control.

•

Where low, medium-height, or high apparatus is required, the recommended
apparatus height takes into consideration fall height from feet to landing surface (e.g.,
mat). Teachers should consider students’ gymnastics experience over the course of
the entire primary school years to determine a reasonable apparatus height
progression. For example, progressing from low apparatus height of 40 centimetres
to medium-height apparatus of 60 centimetres is likely to be more appropriate than
to medium-height apparatus of 45 centimetres.
Low Apparatus
Medium-height Apparatus
High Apparatus

: up to approximately 40 centimetres
: between approximately 40 to 80 centimetres
: between approximately 80 to 95 centimetres.

Apparatus higher than 95 centimetres requires teacher to be in close proximity.
•

For hanging actions, there is no need for students to hang from a high height. Teachers
should consider the fall height from feet to landing surface, as well as students’ grip
strength and overall ability when determining the need for spotting. Generally, a fall
height that exceeds 95 centimetres requires a teacher to be in close proximity.

Lesson Design
• In determining the lesson objectives from the LOs, teachers should design movement
activities with generally no more than a combination of two to three skills and
concepts for initial learning. For example, young children can generally learn to move
in different ways in location/space, changing direction and at different time.
• Teachers can reinforce previously learnt concepts or skills during the introduction of
other new concepts and skills. For example, young children can demonstrate a variety
of locomotor movements reflecting a mastery of the concepts of direction and time,
while learning to incorporate the new concept of pathway in their previous
movements.
• Sequencing activities can be done at various points, and need not only be performed
at the end of the gymnastics module.

Movement Skills and Concepts
Travelling and
Jumping

1. Travel using a variety of locomotor movements on feet in variations
of direction, level, pathway, time and force.
2. Travel using a variety of locomotor movements on different body
parts (e.g., hands and feet, bottom) in variations of shape, direction,
time and pathway.
3. Travel in space, in relation to position (e.g., over/under, through,
around, on/off) with different small apparatus24 (e.g., hoop, rope).
4. Jump using one foot and two feet take-off for distance and height, to
land with control on two feet.
5. Jump using one foot and two feet take-off, to form different shapes,
to land with control on one foot, and on two feet.
6. Jump over a swinging rope held by others several times in succession.

Balancing

1. Balance on a combination of body parts (e.g., hands and feet,
bottom) and in a variety of body positions (e.g., standing, sitting,
lying, kneeling), in symmetrical (e.g., stretch, star, tuck, pike, straddle)
and asymmetrical shapes25.

Rotating

1. Rock using the shape of round-tuck, and coming out of the rock in
various body positions (e.g., standing, kneeling) and body shapes (e.g.
round, wide).
2. Roll using the shapes of narrow-stretch (e.g.,, log roll), round-tuck
(e.g., egg roll) and wide-stretch (e.g., straddle roll) in side direction.

Sequencing

1. Perform a sequence of two different movements (e.g., a travelling
action to a rotating action) with smooth transition.

•
•

Recognise the different locomotor movements and explain the differences and
similarities in these movements.
Demonstrate an understanding of different positions in relation to a partner and
apparatus when travelling in space.
Safety Practices

•

Demonstrate safe behaviour in a physical activity setting with self.

24 The equipment used in gymnastics is commonly referred to as ‘apparatus’. These apparatus for gymnastics range in sizes

from large ones such as vaulting boxes and mats, to hand-held implements such as hoops and ropes, and common physical
education equipment like low hurdles and cones. The apparatus may also be mounted, anchored or freestanding.
25 Head stand and handstand balance variations will be introduced in Primary 3 and Primary 4 respectively. At Primary 1 and
Primary 2, students should focus on exploring a wide variety of balances that do not take most of the body weight on the
hands and head.

Recognise the characteristics of different bases of support in balance activities (e.g.,
point and patch, narrow and wide).
Safety Practices

•

26

Climbing actions are travelling actions with the hands and legs, used to negotiate apparatus with height, such as when
gripping, grasping and crawling to go up, down, over, under and across apparatus.
27
The front, back and side surfaces of the body refer to the large surfaces of the body, such as in patch balances.
28
Flight refers to the phase of the movement when both feet are off the ground, such as during a jump or a leap.
29
Landing in a controlled finish position requires the student to contact the landing surface first with the balls of the feet
(i.e., not flat foot or heel landing), to cushion the landing by bending at the ankles, knees and hips, and to control the landing
by tightening the abdominal muscles and keeping the arms outstretched for balance.

controlled finished position34.
1. Perform a sequence of four different movements (e.g., a travelling action, a
Sequencing
jumping action, another travelling action, and a balancing action) with
smooth transition, and different starting and ending positions.
• Demonstrate an understanding of moving with fluidity from one movement to the next for
smooth transition in sequence work.
• Recognise the key element of a round-tuck roll in the forward and backward direction and
explain the similarities and differences in these movements.
Safety Practices
Demonstrate safe behaviour when participating in physical activities individually (e.g., making
sure that shoelaces are tied, warm-up to prevent injury)

30

Climbing actions are travelling actions with the hands and legs, used to negotiate apparatus with height, such as when
gripping, grasping and crawling to go up, down, over, under and across apparatus.
31
This refers to four-point and three-point balances with the body weight supported with straightened arms, such as in a
push-up (e.g., planked, inverted pike), reverse push-up and side plank positions. The arm supported positions are commonly
known as front support, rear support and side support in gymnastics.
32
Lifting off the hands requires the hands to be placed near the ears, the wrists in extension, the elbows bent and pointing
forward, to support the body weight by pushing off the ground during the inversion phase, taking the stress off the neck.
33
This holding mount on high apparatus requires the body weight to be supported by straightened arms, and the body held
in a plank-like position close to the apparatus. This holding position on a high apparatus is commonly known as front support
in gymnastics.
34
Landing in a controlled finish position requires the student to contact the landing surface first with the balls of the feet
(i.e., not flat foot or heel landing), to cushion the landing by bending at the ankles, knees and hips, and to control the landing
by tightening the abdominal muscles and keeping the arms outstretched for balance.

action followed by a rotating action (in this order), demonstrating varied
movement pathways, with smooth transition and different starting and
ending positions.
• Identify rotation movements of the same planes (i.e., transverse, sagittal, frontal).
• Demonstrate an understanding of the difference between a springy action of a rebound and a
jump.
Safety Practices
• Demonstrate safe behaviour when participating in physical activities individually and with
others (e.g., following the rules and playing fair, cooperating with others)

35

Climbing actions are travelling actions with the hands and legs, used to negotiate apparatus with height, such as when
gripping, grasping and crawling to go up, down, over, under and across apparatus.
36 Landing mats should be provided for all hanging apparatus as far as possible. Consideration should be given to fall height
from feet to landing surface. Generally, a fall height that exceeds 95 centimetres requires a teacher to be in close proximity.
37
The body weight is supported by straightened arms, and the body held in a plank-like position at varying heights away
from the floor surface, according to the ability of the student (e.g., inclined handstand with feet supported on a box). A
handstand is performed when the body and legs are held at the vertical.
38
Commonly known in gymnastics as a ‘Switcheroo’, this is a lead-up to the ‘kicking up’ action to a cartwheel or handstand.
39
A cartwheel is performed when the body and legs pass close to the vertical during rotation.
40
Landing in a controlled finish position requires the student to contact the landing surface first with the balls of the feet
(i.e., not flat foot or heel landing), to cushion the landing by bending at the ankles, knees and hips, and to control the landing
by tightening the abdominal muscles and keeping the arms outstretched for balance.
41
A rebound in gymnastics is a quick upward jump or spring upon landing on the balls of the feet, using very little flexion of
hips, knees or ankles.
42
Three of the five basic gymnastics shapes of stretch, tuck, star, straddle and pike are required here.

and lateral (e.g., side flank) directions, to land on feet in a controlled
finished position).

Sequencing

1. Perform a sequence of six different movements which includes a
jumping action followed by a rotating action (in this order),
demonstrating degrees of body extensions and different movement
planes, with smooth transition.
2. Perform with a partner a sequence of eight different movements each,
which includes pair balances and travelling actions, demonstrating a
variety of position and timing relationship with the partner.

43

Climbing actions are travelling actions with the hands and legs, used to negotiate apparatus with height, such as when
gripping, grasping and crawling to go up, down, over, under and across apparatus.
44
Landing mats should be provided for all hanging apparatus as far as possible. Consideration should be given to fall height
from feet to landing surface. Generally, a fall height that exceeds 95 centimetres requires a teacher to be in close proximity.
45
Counterbalance skills are achieved by having the students form a wide base and leaning against each other. Both must
participate in the counterbalance.
46
Counter-tension skills are achieved by having the students form a small base and pulling away from each other. Both must
participate in the counter-tension.
47
The base refers to the student who is supporting and partially lifting the partner in the balance. This student in the base
position controls the base-top balance. The top refers to the student who is being supported and partially lifted in the
balance.
48
Three of the five basic gymnastics shapes of stretch, tuck, star, straddle and pike are required here.
49 In rebounding vault-overs from a springboard, consideration of apparatus height should be from landing surface to hand
placement surface.

Swimming
Swimming develops students’ confidence to manoeuvre their bodies with control while
experiencing the sensation of water balance, buoyancy and propulsion, in order to facilitate
floating and moving in, under, and on water. The water environment offers unique
challenges to managing body posture in different spatial dimensions, as individuals learn to
coordinate breath control with both synchronous and asynchronous arm and leg actions.
Water play activities emphasising enjoyment during initial learning enhance students’
water movement competence, without losing focus on water safety. Learning moves
progressively from managing personal mobility confidently and safely with and without
floating aids, to emphasis on using specified swim form, and managing water safety for
water-based activities.

OFFERING OF SWIMMING
Beyond teaching fundamental movement skills on land, students will also learn movement
skills through water so as to open up new possibilities in aquatics. Schools will offer swimming
to one cohort of students at any level. The water environment offers unique challenges to the
students in managing their body posture in different spatial dimensions, emphasising
enjoyment during initial learning and ultimately enhancing their water movement
competence, without losing focus on water safety.

Outdoor Education
Outdoor Education engages students’ spirit of adventure, develops their resilience, and
builds their connections with places (i.e., environment and its inhabitants). Students do so
by exploring natural and urban environments, starting from their immediate surroundings
to other unfamiliar places. Students develop appropriate outdoor competencies (i.e.,
knowledge, skills, and attitudes) through physical activities while cultivating an attitude of
care and appreciation for the environment, and thoughtful consideration of the risks and
safety of self and others. Young learners optimise the use of their senses to be comfortable
during their outdoor explorations. Familiar and unfamiliar places, in diverse natural and
urban environments, provide dynamic situations for advanced learners to be adventurous,
safe, and make good judgements in a wider range of outdoor activities. Building of outdoor
competencies and confidence in a variety of authentic contexts would enable students to
apply their learning in new situations and deal with challenges positively. These
experiences provide opportunities for students to explore places while developing
meaningful connections and the responsibility to safeguard them. Through active
participation in these experiences, students learn to enjoy outdoor physical recreation and
take actions to live an active, healthy, and sustainable lifestyle.

OUTDOOR EDUCATION STRANDS
Outdoor Education equips students with outdoor competencies to explore the natural and
urban environments safely and responsibly. The Outdoor Education content is designed
based on three strands, namely: (a) Outdoor Living, (b) Sense of Place, and (c) Risk Assessment
and Management. Figure 5 illustrates the Outdoor Education framework – an overview of the
content to develop the desired Outdoor Education outcomes. This content is anchored on the
three core ideas of Adventure, Resilience, and Connections to enhance student learning
experiences through intentional lesson design and effective pedagogies, supported by
affordances of the learning environment.
a. Outdoor Living
Outdoor living at the primary school level focuses on basic navigational and trip
planning skills to empower enjoyable outdoor participation. In lower primary,
students are encouraged to explore and learn to find their way around the school.
From middle on to upper primary, students learn fundamental spatial awareness and
cognitive skills to navigate around the school’s vicinity as well as basic packing
strategies for different outdoor contexts.
b. Sense of Place
Sense of place emphasises the importance of developing personal connections with
places. Lower primary students are encouraged to observe their environment using
their senses by staying present in and with place. From middle on to upper primary,
they deepen their understanding of places through active engagement with places
and express their connections and experiences through reflection and creative
representations. They also learn and apply environmentally sustainable practices
during their outdoor participation.
c. Risk Assessment and Management
Risk assessment and management introduces simple hazard identification and risk
evaluation strategies to keep one safe in the outdoors. Students apply the “LookThink-Do” process and relevant safety concepts learned in Physical Health and Safety
to various outdoor situations. They learn how to make safe and responsible decisions
so they can enjoy outdoor participation.

Figure 5. Outdoor Education Framework
The Outdoor Education lessons provide the foundation for the outdoor competencies that
will enable students to be comfortable and engage in outdoor adventure experiences
meaningfully. They develop a sense of connectedness with the places visited; for example,
students exhibit curiosity and care to better understand and appreciate the environment and
its inhabitants. This connectedness with place is likely to evoke students’ appreciation for the
place and motivates them to show care for it. When enjoying the outdoors, students adopt a
safety mindset to make sound judgements and decisions for the safety of self and others.
Such meaningful Outdoor Education experiences empower students to enjoy the benefits of
being in nature and the outdoors. This also promotes students’ willingness to increase their
engagement in outdoor adventure, as part of living out an active and healthy lifestyle (see
purpose of Physical Education in Section 1).

LESSON DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
When designing and implementing Outdoor Education lessons, teachers should note the
following:

Progression and Learning Environments
This syllabus leverages place-responsive pedagogy and experiential learning approach to
increase relevance for Outdoor Education learning using authentic contexts. MOE’s placeresponsive pedagogical framework (details in Section 5) guides teachers in their
understanding of how place is relevant to learning in Outdoor Education and how teachers
82
OFFICIAL (CLOSED) / NON-SENSITIVE
FOR USE BY EDUCATION OFFICERS ONLY

can empower students in discovering the distinctiveness of places. The five pedagogical foci,
when taught in a spiral and progressive manner, enable students to build personal
connections with places during exploration. As students learn place-responsive skills under
the sense of place strand and have repeated engaging experiences to learn more about
places, the process will deepen their desire to connect with places and its inhabitants. At the
end of primary level, students are empowered to develop special relationships with places
and its inhabitants; they evolve from learning about places to connecting with them.
Teachers should design activities to facilitate students’ movement while considering the
affordances of places in a variety of learning environments with urban and green spaces.
These may include outdoor sports facilities, corridors, gardens, parks and water bodies within
the school and its neighbourhood community. To develop students’ connectedness to place
or nature, learning opportunities should enable students to spend time to connect with place
or green spaces. During lessons, they explore the surroundings in an engaging and meaningful
way, guided by the place-responsive pedagogical foci. In this learning process, they find
stories of others’ connection to place; they create new stories of their personal connection;
and they are facilitated to create their representations of place. Most importantly, they
experience joy when learning about self, others, and the environment when in the outdoors.
Teachers and students should establish and enforce routines for use of equipment and
expected behaviour for safe and respectful exploration of places. For example, before the
start of each lesson, students are empowered to check the weather forecast to gain
information for any outdoor learning. In the outdoors, students keep to the boundaries and
know how to stay safe and be respectful to others and the environment while making
themselves comfortable. Learning opportunities that impress upon students the desired
outdoor attitudes to engage their spirit of adventure, develop their resilience and build
connections with places should also be incorporated in every lesson.
As with other aspects of learning, skill development should be scaffolded, conducted in stages
and enjoyable for learners. Some outdoor competencies can be achieved through 1 or 2
lessons, whileothers will require distributed practice througha series of lessons. Teachers
should reinforce previously learnt competencies during the introduction of new knowledge
and skills. By drawing connections from their experiences, students develop their
understanding and mastery of outdoor competencies within a holistic curriculum.

APPLICATION OF LEARNING IN AUTHENTIC CONTEXT
Themes
The Outdoor Education content is organised by themes revolving around exploring places.
Table 7 shows the themes across the primary school years for Outdoor Education lessons and
culminating events. The learning outcomes are designed to align with the progressive learning
contexts and focus on enabling students to explore places, starting from students’ immediate
surroundings (e.g., school for lower primary) to other unfamiliar locations (e.g., outdoor
campsite for upper primary). Themes are coupled with the pedagogical foci (see Section 5) to
emphasise the importance of spending time to connect with places, ranging from exploration
83
OFFICIAL (CLOSED) / NON-SENSITIVE
FOR USE BY EDUCATION OFFICERS ONLY

(Primary 1-2), learning about places (Primary 3-4), and developing connectedness with it
(Primary 5-6).
Themes are also used to increase relevance for learning and allow integration of the three
strands using authentic contexts. The learning outcomes from the three strands should be
integrated (where possible) in the lessons instead of being taught in isolation. For example,
in lower primary levels, students discover more about their school by being present in and
with places they explore using sensory cues. At the same time, students should exhibit these
outdoor competencies whilst adopting a safety mindset. Lessons for each level are designed
to learn outdoor competencies required for students to engage in topics relating to the
assigned theme before moving to the next level.

Culminating Events
Beyond the lessons, students should be given opportunities to apply what they have learnt in
authentic contexts such as camps, expeditions, and learning journeys. These contexts engage
students’ senses to connect with place, presenting them with opportunities for problemsolving and decision-making to develop their spirit of adventure and resilience, both
individually and in groups. Students learn how to prepare for these contexts, move through
the respective outdoor environments with others meaningfully, confidently, and safely, whilst
ensuring their basic needs are met. They also experience actual consequences of their actions
and decisions that affect themselves, the environment, and the people around them. Hence,
students should participate in:
•
•

a day trip in the school’s neighbourhood, by the end of Primary 4; and
a 3-Day 2-Night outdoor adventure learning cohort camp by the end of Primary 5.

By the end of Primary 4, students embark on a day trip to deepen their personal connections
with their school by learning more about the green spaces in the immediate vicinity of the
school neighbourhood. Prior to the day trip, they will learn ways of observing their
surroundings when exploring the school grounds safely and optimising the use of their senses
to stay present and focused. At the day trip, students will apply their outdoor competencies
learned during lessons to discover nature from different perspectives in their school’s
neighbourhood. This culminating event also serves as a way to prepare students for going
outdoors with their friends before undertaking residential camps at the next level.
At Primary 5 and 6, students are provided the opportunities to synthesise, apply and make
responsible and safe decisions based on basic outdoor competencies they have learnt
through authentic situations and tasks set in the outdoors. For instance, students apply these
competencies during their 3-Day 2-Night outdoor adventure learning cohort camp with their
peers where they will plan and undertake a half-day trip to connect with outdoor places near
the campsite safely. Through the primary school years, they will learn to spend time to
connect with their immediate environment, gain greater awareness and appreciation of their
school and the surrounding neighbourhood, and develop a desire to care for the environment
through small actions.

Physical Health and Safety
Physical Health and Safety stimulates students’ interest in physical activity as meaningful
connections between health concepts and practical applications are made through
experiential learning. Through authentic learning experiences, students develop an
understanding in physical health concepts, healthy and active living, safe practices, and
personal hygiene. They pursue physical activities that interest them regularly and safely,
make healthier food choices and take care of themselves. Building on the knowledge, skills
and learning experiences, students learn to evaluate their lifestyles and work towards
healthier behaviours. As students mature, they build the commitment to lead an active and
heathy lifestyle and encourage others to do so.

PHYSICAL HEALTH AND SAFETY STRANDS
The content areas are organised under the four strands, namely: (a) Physical Fitness, (b)
Safety and Risk Management, (c) Nutrition, and (d) Personal Hygiene and Self-Care. Through
the four strands, students develop an understanding of physical health concepts, healthy and
active living, safe practices, and personal hygiene. With the understanding, students apply
the skills and knowledge to participate in physical activities regularly and safely, make
healthier food choices and take care of themselves, developing a sense of personal
responsibility towards active and healthy living. Students make connections between what
they have learn in class and their environment to exhibit health-enhancing behaviours and
work towards sustained commitment in safe, active and healthy lifestyles. To better facilitate
students in making the connections, some of the learning outcomes for Safety and Physical
Fitness are integrated into the Physical Activity and Outdoor Education learning areas.
a. Physical Fitness
Physical Fitness at the primary school level focuses on the fundamental role of physical
activity and fitness related components to keep one healthy and fit. In lower primary,
students are introduced to the importance of regular engagement in physical activities
and the association of movements and functions of different body parts in physical
activities. From middle to upper primary, students learn about the different intensity
of physical activities (e.g., providing students with some common examples of sports
and non-sports physical activities related such as household chores that fall into the
moderate and vigorous categories) and are equipped with skills and knowledge on
developing the components of health-related and skills-related fitness.
b. Safety and Risk Management
Safety is introduced to students through contextual examples which include “Road
Safety”, “Safety in School”, “Safety in Public Transport”, “Water Safety”, “Sports
Safety” and “Fire & Electrical Safety”. Students will learn the “Look-Think-Do” process
which guides them on the aspects of safety to look at and what to do to keep
themselves safe. In Sports Safety, students are aware of the need to warm-up and
cool-down before and after exercise, and ways to prevent injuries when participating
in physical activities. Students are reminded to hydrate themselves sufficiently before,
during and after exercising. Students will know what to do in an emergency,
specifically to seek help when someone is injured or suspect of cardiac arrest. Students
are also aware of how to treat minor cuts, burns, nose bleeds and apply PRICE61 to
sprains.
c. Nutrition
Students understand the importance of a balanced diet and that they need to eat from
all four food groups and be aware of the portion of food from each food group to
consume. Students know the need to limit sugar intake and unhealthy food, and are
equipped with the skills to choose healthier food using nutrition labels on packages
and knowing healthier cooking methods.
61 PRICE is the acronym for treatment of injury. It stands for Protection, Rest, Ice, Compression and Elevation.

92
OFFICIAL (CLOSED) / NON-SENSITIVE

d. Personal Hygiene and Self-Care
Students understand the importance of and exhibit good personal hygiene such as
wash their hands, brush their teeth, clean their body/hair and face, change their
clothes and puberty hygiene. Within these topics, students learn about good eye, oral
and auditory care. Students are also introduced to other health-enhancing behaviours
such as regular participation in physical activities, healthy eating, and sufficient sleep
and rest. Riding on basic knowledge of germs, the routes of transmission (e.g., from
person to person, animal to human and food to human) and causes of diseases (e.g.,
bacteria, viruses, parasites and fungi), students are aware of how to prevent the
diseases and protect themselves. In addition, they know and put into practice
responsible actions to prevent the spread of these diseases.

APPLICATION OF LEARNING IN AUTHENTIC CONTEXT
Students will apply the skills and knowledge to make informed decisions related to physical
health in their daily life. They will be guided to identify and work on a health practice for
personal improvement for each year, from Primary 3 to 6. Applying guidelines, and health
concepts and skills (e.g., goal setting), students identify specific areas to work on such as
regular physical activity, healthy eating and sufficient sleep. As they work on these health
practices, they identify the barriers to demonstrate these practices and develop ways to
overcome them.

2.3 Character and Citizenship Education Developmental
Milestones (Primary Level)
In this Physical Education syllabus, learning outcomes are identified for each core value,
presented in the form of related social-emotional competencies (as Developmental
Milestones). Teachers consciously plan for progressive learning experiences where students
are able to put competencies into practice over a sustained period of learning, leading to the
development of core values. The Physical Education lessons primarily focus on the
psychomotor and cognitive outcomes. Thereafter, the affective outcomes are appropriately
layered over the physical activities, while maintaining high physical and cognitive engagement
time.
These Developmental Milestones are not intended to be benchmarks for evaluation purposes
but as reference points for coordination and alignment in Character and Citizenship Education
efforts to achieve coherence across subjects and learning experiences in schools.

3. SECONDARY LEVEL SYLLABUS CONTENT
3.1 Overview
KEY ATTRIBUTES OF STUDENTS AND LEARNING EXPERIENCES
For students to achieve the goals of Physical Education, the journey continues at the secondary
level. Physical Education at the secondary level aims to develop Confident Participants with
positive self-efficacy who value the need for sustainability in an active and healthy lifestyle.
At the secondary level, Physical Education allows students to enhance their performance
capacity in physical activities by building on the foundational competencies learnt across
different movement experiences. Students deepen their understanding and enrich their
performance capacity through the application of skills and concepts strategically across a
variety of authentic physical activity settings such as an individual and team recreational game
of their choice with confidence. This positive self-efficacy is developed through the learning of
specialised skills and concepts that enhance students’ experiences in the participation of
specific physical activities. These physical activities take place in a variety of social and physical
learning contexts, which allows students to build mastery through repeated practice and
feedback.
Additionally, students learn technical outdoor competencies involving more tools and
equipment, which deepen their understanding and mastery of outdoor living skills in navigation,
shelter building, outdoor cooking, and trip planning. They learn to make good judgement in preemptive planning and application of risk assessment and management during dynamic
situations in the outdoors. As they engage in more self-directed learning experiences in school
and during cohort camps at unfamiliar environments, it reinforces the positive belief in their
outdoor competencies. With repeated exposure and practice, students develop greater
confidence to engage in small-scale adventures, apply their learning in new situations, and deal
with challenges positively. They also deepen their understanding of places around them and
desire to connect with and contribute to places and its community.
Building on the understanding of the importance of healthy eating and benefits of regular
participation in physical activities in primary level, students are encouraged to further broaden
their repertoire of health concepts and skills. They are then better able to make informed
decisions and demonstrate practices, either alone, with friends or with family that contributes
towards active and healthy living.
With the increasing complexity of tasks, students enrich their capacity in physical activities,
including the outdoors and health-enhancing practices, which builds their self-efficacy. The
meaningful application of students’ learning in authentic physical activity settings also plays a
vital role in developing their belief in the value of sustainability for the learning and participation
in recreational physical activities, including the outdoors at post-secondary level. Through the
well-planned learning experiences in the different learning areas, students develop their
mature performance and be Confident Participants.

Learning Outcomes
The learning Outcomes (LOs) in the learning areas for the secondary level build on the
movement capacity and knowledge that were learnt at the primary level.
For Physical Activity, the LOs are premised on the expected student competence in a
recreational context at the end of each module. Thus, the LOs for the physical activities are
applicable to any level in secondary schools.
For Outdoor Education, the LOs are organised in a modular format in the topics of Navigation,
Outdoor Cooking, Shelter Building, and Trip Planning, and show integration of the 3 strands.
Each topic consists of two modules and specifies minimally what students should achieve by
the end of Secondary 1 and by the end of Secondary 3. In other words, the content to be
achieved by the end of Secondary 3 can be taught in Secondary 2 and/or Secondary 3 to
prepare students for their outdoor adventure learning cohort camps.
The LOs for Physical Health and Safety specify minimally what students should know and be
able to do for these two areas by the end of each secondary level. The content in the four
strands of Physical Health are taught from Secondary 1 to 4.

Application of Learning in Authentic Context
By end of their secondary school education, students will have experienced the following
culminating events:
•
•
•
•
•

at least 3 recreational competitions organised by the school by the end of Secondary
4/5
a 4-Day 3-Night outdoor adventure learning cohort camp by the end of Secondary 1
a 5-Day 4-Night outdoor adventure learning cohort camp by the end of Secondary 3
develop and enact an exercise plan to achieve a personal goal for physical health in
Secondary 2
develop and enact a plan to form a health practice(s) towards healthier behaviour(s)
in Secondary 4

Students’ confidence in their skills and knowledge is reinforced through the positive
experiences from the three learning areas and the respective culminating events/activities.
By the end of secondary level, students have a positive belief in their movement
competencies, and consciously seize opportunities to continually learn and participate in
recreational physical activities, including the outdoors with family and friends at postsecondary level.

SECONDARY 5 GUIDELINES
At the end of Secondary 4, students are competent in at least 5 different physical activities
and are enthusiastic in participation. Thus, for the additional year in secondary school, the
focus will be on further enabling students to lead an active and healthy lifestyle after they
leave school.
In Secondary 5, schools should make provisions for students to have increased practice time
and the opportunity to take part in an additional physical activity of their choice (i.e., 6
physical activities across 5 years) provided by the school. Building on the experience that the
Physical Education syllabus has provided for them from Secondary 1 to 4, the syllabus for
Secondary 5 will provide students time for refinement of skills. It is during this time when
students can be encouraged to better themselves. They should set targets, aspire to meet
them and perform at a higher level in the physical activity. Teachers can guide the students
through the practices to help them perform better. This will provide them with a richer
experience as they strive to enhance their competency in the various physical activities.
Equipped with the knowledge acquired from Secondary 1 to 4 in Physical Health and Safety,
students will be able to make meaningful connections and apply the knowledge in
preparation for the pursuit of physical activities. Students should be able to assess their own
fitness and plan an exercise programme to improve their overall fitness. Students should
enjoy the physical activities safely and subsequently influence family and friends towards
active lifestyle.

3.2 Learning Areas
Physical Activity
Physical Activities provide the contexts for students to display various fundamental
movement skills, either individually or in combination that they have learnt at the primary
level. Students will draw on early experiences and develop, with confidence, mature
patterns that they can display and perform at a recreational competition level. In Games
and Sports, games-related concepts and strategies are consciously weaved into appropriate
game situations, together with an emphasis on the learning and demonstration of values
like integrity, respect and resilience. This emphasis extends to other categories of physical
activities like Athletics and Swimming, where skills and concepts are taught in tandem with
values. For these physical activities, students are encouraged to participate in challenges
that increase their personal performances by testing themselves against their peers in noncompetitive contexts where the focus remains on improving one’s personal best. Students
make use of the experiences that they have gained through the active participation in
physical activities and are motivated to lead an active and healthy lifestyle.

PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES GUIDELINES
The more common physical activities for Singaporeans are individual/dual in nature. These
activities require one or two people to participate in and thus have a higher chance of them
being undertaken beyond secondary school. Examples of such activities are jogging and
badminton. In the offering of physical activities, schools should cater for individual/dual
activities as well as to give students the opportunity to participate from a range of physical
activities offered by the school. Schools, therefore, can choose to offer physical activities that
are new, exciting and different from the primary level syllabus based on the needs, interests
and profile of their students, bearing in mind practical considerations. This is to ensure quality
participation and engagement during the learning and at the same time increase the
likelihood of them sustaining their participation in the activity of their choice beyond
secondary school.
Students must be able to participate in physical activities competently so that they can enjoy
participating and are motivated to continue with physical activities of their choice after they
leave secondary school. Only when students are provided with sufficient time and
opportunities for application and learning will they be able to achieve the desired level of
competency which will be on display in the respective culminating events in the physical
activities.
The physical activities offered by the schools should fulfil the following guidelines:
•
•
•

Schools should offer at least five different physical activities for every student.
The five physical activities must be offered from at least two games categories
(territorial-invasion, net-barrier and striking-fielding).
Among the five physical activities, at least one of them should be an individual/dual
physical activity.

Table 10 shows the categorisation of the commonly taught physical activities in Singapore
schools.
In the physical activities offered by the school, each physical activity must fulfil the following:
•
•
•
•
•

have at least 16 hours of curriculum time that will develop the ability of the student
to participate independently, safely and with enough competence to be a participant
at a recreational level
include learning outcomes which are aligned to the five goals of Physical Education
have a culminating event (either through an end-state game or achieving a set target)
provide students with instruction and the opportunity to participate competently
incorporate fitness components such as suitable resistance exercises using body
weight and safety practices for students to apply their learning in the Physical Health
and Safety learning area

Table 10. More Commonly Taught Physical Activities in Schools (Non-Exhaustive List)
Schools can offer physical activities that are not listed in the syllabus document (e.g.,
Handball) as long as the design of the physical activity adheres to the requirements above. In
designing the school-based physical activity LOs, the schools are to ensure the following:
•
•
•

The LOs have the level of demand equivalent to the LOs for the physical activities listed
in the syllabus document.
All games-related concepts within the games category are adopted. [For Games only]
The content is age-appropriate, involving skills and knowledge (e.g., with complexity
of skills, techniques or tactical / strategic /compositional elements).

In addition, schools should take into consideration the following curricular questions before
embarking on designing the school-based physical activity LOs:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

How does offering this physical activity benefit the learning experiences of the
students?
Does the department have a clear rationale for offering this physical activity?
What are some of the safety considerations the school should note?
Does the school have the facility/space required to teach this physical activity
meaningfully?
Is the equipment required to teach this physical activity readily available?
Does the department have teachers who are competent to be deployed to teach this
physical activity?
Can the offering of this physical activity be sustained in the school?

GAMES-RELATED CONCEPTS AND SKILLS
Games-related concepts63 are introduced to students through modified games at the upper
primary and reinforced at the secondary levels. Both fundamental and specialised skills and
movement concepts are required in playing these games. In this syllabus, games are classified
into the following categories:
•
•
•

net-barrier
striking-fielding
territorial-invasion

Within each game category, there are games-related concepts that are transferrable across
games within the same category. Game-specific skills are also identified for selected games
for the learning area of Physical Activities. Table 11 describes the main intention of the game
category and the games-related concepts across the three game categories. Questions in
italics style can foster critical thinking and problem solving among the students. When done
appropriately, these questions also help students to identify the games-related concepts and
skills required.

APPLICATION OF LEARNING IN AUTHENTIC CONTEXT
By the end of Secondary 4/5, students will have experienced at least 3 recreational
competitions organised by the school. Competition provides a platform for students to apply
the skills and values learnt during Physical Education lessons in an authentic context. This
inclusion is not to propel all students towards playing competitive sports. Instead, it serves as
an important platform to expose our students to real-life sports settings and in the process
acquire relevant 21st Century Competencies to cope with the fast-changing world.
Competition mirrors life. One works as an individual or in a team towards a common goal,
handling stress and pressure, celebrating success, bouncing back from failures, and etc.
Participation in competitions can help students recognise their strengths and weaknesses,
learn to collaborate and communicate with others, develop adaptive thinking through
responding to and creating solutions in unexpected or difficult situations, and build resilience
in handling ups and downs. While the stress and pressure to win may pose a challenge to
some students, it will serve as a good opportunity to teach our students to be confident of
their own abilities and better handle winning and losing.
To help students enjoy and reap the benefits of the competition experience, a teacher will
have to be mindful of structuring Physical Education lessons appropriately to create a positive
learning environment. They should constantly emphasise doing one’s best in practice tasks
and in competition to highlight that the process is more important and meaningful than

to introduce appropriate skills to help students develop 21st Century Competencies.
Recreational competitions are at intra-school level and students can participate in with their
classmates. Rules and competition formats are modified to ensure age-appropriateness of
the activities. Team compositions will be smaller so that play time can be longer and more
students can participate. The format of the competition can also comprise groupings of
similar ability where students will have opportunities to play at least 3 matches in their
assigned grouping. There is no need for the lead up to an overall champion.

Badminton
DESCRIPTION OF THE GAME
Students play a singles badminton game, with appropriate rules.
During game play, students execute skills of foot work, service and shuttle control, as well as a
combination of skills with good form to achieve the intended outcomes. Application of good
footwork to support swift movement in court is fundamental in sustaining the rallies to ultimately
apply tactical strategies. In offence, students exploit space to create attacking opportunities or
capitalise on mistakes made by opponents to win a point. In defence, students cover available court
space adequately to limit opponents’ offensive attack as well as returning the shuttle to place the
opponents in a less advantageous offensive position.

Mini/Paddle Tennis
DESCRIPTION OF THE GAME
Students play a singles tennis game using sponge balls, with appropriate rules.
During game play, students execute skills of foot work, service and racquet/paddle control, as well
as a combination of skills with good form to achieve the intended outcomes. Application of good
footwork to support swift movement in court is fundamental in sustaining the rallies to ultimately
apply tactical strategies. In offence, students exploit space to create attacking opportunities or
capitalise on mistakes made by opponents to win a point. In defence, students cover available court
space adequately to limit opponents’ offensive attack as well as returning the ball to place the
opponents in a less advantageous offensive position.

DESCRIPTION OF THE GAME
Students play a 3v3 half-court basketball game, with appropriate rules.
During game play, students execute skills of passing, dribbling, and shooting, as well as a
combination of skills with good form to achieve the intended outcomes. They also apply good
footwork to change speed and direction, stop in balance, and pivot when enacting offensive and
defensive strategies. Passing accurately to teammates is key to advancing the ball while maintaining
possession. In attacking the basket, students make use of available space to penetrate the defence
and support teammate to score, or create space to set up attacking opportunities if none is obvious.
In defending the basket, the team works together to slow down an attack by guarding the attackers,
denying attacking space, preventing scoring and attempting to regain possession of the ball.

Non-Contact Rugby
DESCRIPTION OF THE GAME
Students play a 4v4 rugby game without scrummaging, tackling and mauling, with appropriate
rules.
During game play, student execute skills of catching and passing, evasive running, scoring and
defending as well as a combination of skills with good form to achieve the intended outcomes.
Students demonstrate adequate ball handling skills, evasive running and spatial awareness that
guides students’ decision-making ability to score points. The attacking team is allowed to pass the
ball sideways or backwards while running forward to score by placing the ball in the score zone (try
line). Upon being tagged, the ball carrier must stop and pass the ball to a teammate to carry on
with play and attempt to score. In defence, students apply pressure on the ball carrier to delay
invasion, deny space and opportunities to score by tracking and tagging ball carriers, and regain
possession of the ball.
Recommended play area: Length: 50 metres, Width: 30 metres
Recommended ball size: Rugby - Size 4 ball

Netball
DESCRIPTION OF THE GAME
Students play a 4v4, half court netball game, with appropriate rules.
During game play, students execute skills of passing and shooting, as well as a combination of skills
with good form to achieve the intended outcomes. They also apply good footwork to pivot, change
speed and direction as well as stop in balance when enacting offensive and defensive strategies.
The key to advancing the ball while maintaining possession is to pass accurately to teammates. In
attacking, students create or make use of available space to penetrate opponents’ defence to set
up attacking opportunities for shooters to score. In defending, the team works together to slow
down an attack by guarding the attackers, denying attacking space, preventing scoring and
attempting to regain possession of the ball.

Ultimate Frisbee
DESCRIPTION OF THE GAME
Students play a 5v5 territorial game using a flying disc, with appropriate rules.
During game play, students are able to apply or combine throwing and catching skills to attack the
end-zone goal. They are also able to demonstrate good footwork to change directions through
pivoting and stopping with balance in both offensive and defensive situations. In attacking the endzone goal, students are able to work with teammates through creating space and penetrating
defence to set up offensive opportunities. In defending the end-zone, students work with
teammates to deny space for invasion through person-to-person defence, prevent scoring and
attempting to regain possession of the disc. Students would also be able to self-referee their game
play and be responsible for adhering to and overseeing the rules themselves.
Recommended size of play area: Length – 37 metres to 43 metres, Width – 18 metres to 22 metres

Outdoor Education
Outdoor Education engages students’ spirit of adventure, develops their resilience, and
builds their connections with places (i.e., environment and its inhabitants). Students do so
by exploring natural and urban environments, ranging from their immediate surroundings
to other unfamiliar places. Students develop appropriate outdoor competencies (i.e.,
knowledge, skills, and attitudes) through physical activities while cultivating an attitude of
care and appreciation for the environment, and thoughtful consideration of the risks and
safety of self and others. Young learners optimise the use of their senses to be comfortable
during their outdoor explorations. Familiar and unfamiliar places, in diverse natural and
urban environments, provide dynamic situations for advanced learners to be adventurous,
safe, and make good judgements in a wider range of outdoor activities. Building of outdoor
competencies and confidence in a variety of authentic contexts would enable students to
adapt to new situations and deal with challenges positively. These experiences provide
opportunities for students to explore places while developing meaningful connections and
the responsibility to safeguard them. Through active participation in these experiences,
students learn to enjoy outdoor physical recreation and take actions to live an active,
healthy, and sustainable lifestyle.

OUTDOOR EDUCATION STRANDS
Outdoor Education equips students with outdoor competencies to explore the natural and
urban environments safely and responsibly. The Outdoor Education content is designed
based on three strands, namely: (a) Outdoor Living, (b) Sense of Place, and (c) Risk Assessment
and Management. Figure 6 illustrates the Outdoor Education framework – an overview of the
content to develop the desired Outdoor Education outcomes. This content is anchored on the
three core ideas of Adventure, Resilience and Connections to enhance student learning
experiences through intentional lesson design and effective pedagogies, supported by
affordances of the learning environment.
a. Outdoor Living
Outdoor living at the secondary school level deepens students’ understanding and
mastery of outdoor living skills in navigation, shelter building, outdoor cooking, and
trip planning. They learn more technical outdoor competencies involving more tools
and equipment; they also develop good judgement in pre-emptive planning, and
application of risk assessment and management during dynamic situations in the
outdoors. As students engage in more self-directed learning experiences in school and
during cohort camps in unfamiliar environments, it reinforces the positive belief in
their outdoor competencies.
b. Sense of Place
Sense of place emphasises the importance of developing personal connections with
places. They build on their place-responsive knowledge and skills, as well as
environmentally sustainable practices learnt in primary school. At secondary level,
they continue to deepen their place connectedness by developing a holistic
understanding of places around them. They are empowered to connect with,
appreciate, and contribute to sustainable places and their communities.
c. Risk Assessment and Management
Risk assessment and management focuses on hazard identification during dynamic
situations in the outdoors, risk evaluation and mitigation for outdoor participation. A
‘safety mindset' is instilled in students and they are empowered to make safe and
responsible decisions so they can enjoy outdoor participation.

145
OFFICIAL (CLOSED) / NON-SENSITIVE

Figure 6. Outdoor Education Framework
The Outdoor Education lessons provide the foundation for the outdoor competencies that
will enable students to be comfortable and engage in outdoor adventure experiences
meaningfully. They develop a sense of connectedness with the places visited; for example,
students exhibit curiosity and care to better understand and appreciate the environment and
its inhabitants. This connectedness with place is likely to evoke students’ appreciation for the
place and motivate them to show care for it. When enjoying the outdoors, students adopt a
safety mindset to make sound judgements and decisions for the safety of self and others.
Such meaningful Outdoor Education experiences empower students to enjoy the benefits of
being in nature and the outdoors. This also promotes students’ willingness to increase their
engagement in outdoor adventure, as part of living out an active and healthy lifestyle (see
purpose of Physical Education in Section 1).

LESSON DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
When designing and implementing Outdoor Education lessons, teachers should note the
following:

Progression and Learning Environments
This syllabus leverages place-responsive pedagogy and experiential learning approach to
increase relevance for Outdoor Education learning using authentic contexts. MOE’s placeresponsive pedagogical framework (details in Section 5) guides teachers in their
understanding of how place is relevant to learning in Outdoor Education and how teachers
can empower students in discovering the distinctiveness of places. The five pedagogical foci,
when taught in a spiral and progressive manner, enable students to build personal
146
OFFICIAL (CLOSED) / NON-SENSITIVE
FOR USE BY EDUCATION OFFICERS ONLY

connections with places during exploration. As students learn place-responsive skills under
the sense of place strand and have repeated engaging experiences to learn more about
places, the process will deepen their desire to connect with places and its inhabitants. At the
end of secondary level, students are empowered to develop special relationships with places
and its inhabitants; they evolve from learning about places to caring for them through small
actions.
Teachers should design activities to facilitate students’ movement while considering the
affordances of places in a variety of learning environments with urban and green spaces.
These may include outdoor sports facilities, corridors, gardens, parks and water bodies within
the school and its neighbourhood. To develop students’ connectedness to place or nature,
learning opportunities should enable students to spend time to connect with places, including
green and/ or blue spaces. During lessons, they explore the surroundings in an engaging and
meaningful way, guided by the place-responsive pedagogical foci. In this learning process,
they find stories of others’ connection to place; they create new stories of their personal
connection; and they are facilitated to create their representations of place. Most
importantly, they experience joy when learning about self, others, and the environment when
in the outdoors.
Teachers and students should establish and enforce routines for use of equipment and
expected behaviour for safe and respectful exploration of places. For example, before the
start of each lesson, students are empowered to check the weather forecast to gain
information useful for outdoor learning. In the outdoors, students keep to the boundaries,
know how to stay safe, and show respect to others and the environment while making
themselves comfortable. Learning opportunities that impress upon students the desired
outdoor attitudes to engage their spirit of adventure, develop their resilience and build
connections with places should also be incorporated in every lesson.
As with other aspects of learning, skill development should be scaffolded, conducted in stages
and enjoyable for learners. Some outdoor competencies can be achieved through 1 or 2
lessons, while others will require distributed practice through a series of lessons. Teachers
should reinforce previously learnt competencies during the introduction of new knowledge
and skills. By drawing connections from their experiences, students gain deeper
understanding and mastery of outdoor competencies within a holistic curriculum.

MODULAR FORMAT AND LEARNING OUTCOMES
The learning outcomes are organised in a modular format in the topics of navigation, outdoor
cooking, shelter building, and trip planning. Each topic consists of two modules and specifies
minimally what students should achieve by the end of Secondary 1 and by the end of
Secondary 3. Ideally, students should complete the Secondary 1 content in preparation for
their 4-Day 3-Night outdoor adventure learning cohort camps. For content to be achieved by
the end of Secondary 3, it can be taught in Secondary 2 and/or Secondary 3 to prepare
students for their 5-Day 4-Night outdoor adventure learning cohort camps.

APPLICATION OF LEARNING IN AUTHENTIC CONTEXT
Themes
The Outdoor Education content is organised by themes revolving around exploring places.
Table 12 shows the themes across the secondary school years for Outdoor Education lessons
and culminating events. The learning outcomes are designed to align with the progressive
learning contexts and focus on enabling students to explore places, starting from students’
immediate surroundings (e.g., new school environment in Secondary 1) to other unfamiliar
locations (e.g., outdoor campsites or overseas locations). Themes are coupled with the
pedagogical foci (see Section 5) to emphasise the importance of spending time to connect
with places, starting from learning about places to developing special relationships with them
and their inhabitants in primary levels. For secondary levels, students build on these placeresponsive competencies. In lower secondary levels, they deepen their connectedness and
appreciation of place. At upper secondary levels, they are facilitated to gain an awareness of
potential social and environmental concerns of the place and possibly, create small initiatives
to care for it.
Themes are used to increase relevance for learning and allow integration of the three strands
using authentic contexts. The learning outcomes from the three strands should be integrated
(where possible) instead of being taught in isolation. For example, Secondary 1 students will
learn navigational skills to explore the distinctiveness of the new school environment; they
gain a holistic understanding of the place by spending time to build personal connections with
it. Students should exhibit these outdoor competencies whilst adopting a safety mindset.
Lessons for each level are designed such that students learn the outdoor competencies
required for them to engage in topics relating to the assigned theme before moving to the
next level. Some modules are more relatable to the assigned themes while others may appear
more technical in nature. On the whole, the various modules at each level develop students’
outdoor competencies that can be applied during their cohort camps and enable them to
enjoy camping and appreciate the outdoors.

Culminating Events
Beyond the lessons, students should be given opportunities to apply what they have learnt in
authentic contexts such as camps, expeditions and learning journeys. These contexts engage
students’ senses to connect with place, presenting them with opportunities for problemsolving and decision-making to develop their spirit of adventure and resilience, both
individually and in groups. Students learn how to prepare for these contexts, move through
the respective outdoor environments with others meaningfully, confidently, and safely, whilst
ensuring their basic needs are met. They also experience actual consequences of their actions
and decisions that affect themselves, the environment, and the people around them. Hence,
students should participate in:
•
•

a 4-Day 3-Night outdoor adventure learning cohort camp by the end of Secondary 1;
and
a 5-Day 4-Night outdoor adventure learning cohort camp by the end of Secondary 3.
148

At Secondary 1, students apply the outdoor competencies learnt in primary school to develop
a sense of place with their new school environment. They continue to deepen their outdoor
competencies; they learn more complex knowledge and skills during their Secondary 1
Outdoor Education lessons in preparation for extended residential camping. They will then
apply these competencies during a 4-Day 3-Night residential camp with their peers where
they will plan and undertake a day trip during the camp to connect with outdoor places
outside the campsite safely. This culminating event provides opportunities for students to
synthesise, apply and make meaningful and safe decisions in authentic situations and tasks
set in the outdoors.
At Secondary 3, they would have developed key outdoor competencies to navigate their way
around unfamiliar places and make meaningful and safe decisions in an outdoor
setting. Through the education years, they will gradually develop a personal connection with
places such as their school and the surrounding neighbourhood and be empowered to take
action to care for these places.

Physical Health and Safety
Physical Health and Safety support students in their development of healthy lifestyle
practices and pursuit of a lifetime of active and healthy living. Through authentic learning
experiences, students develop an understanding in physical health concepts, healthy and
active living, safe practices, and personal hygiene. They pursue physical activities that
interest them regularly and safely, make healthier food choices and take care of
themselves. Building on the knowledge, skills and learning experiences, students learn to
evaluate their lifestyles and work towards healthier behaviours. As students mature, they
build the commitment to lead an active and heathy lifestyle and encourage others to do so.

154

PHYSICAL HEALTH AND SAFETY STRANDS
The content areas are organised under the four strands, namely: (a) Physical Fitness, (b)
Safety and Risk Management, (c) Nutrition, and (d) Personal Hygiene and Self-Care. Through
the four strands, students develop an understanding of physical health concepts, healthy and
active living, safe practices, and personal hygiene. With the understanding, students apply
the skills and knowledge to participate in physical activities regularly and safely, make
healthier food choices and take care of themselves, developing a sense of personal
responsibility towards active and healthy living. Students make connections between what
they have learn in class and their environment to exhibit health-enhancing behaviours and
work towards sustained commitment in safe, active and healthy lifestyles. To better facilitate
students making the connections, some of the learning outcomes for safety and physical
fitness are integrated into the Physical Activities and Outdoor Education learning areas.
a. Physical Fitness
Physical fitness refers to the ability of the body systems to work together efficiently
to allow one to be healthy and perform activities of daily living. Through this strand,
students are introduced to concepts and knowledge related to the musculoskeletal
system and its relation to physical activities and physical fitness, and the benefits of
physical activities to physical health and fitness. Students will be equipped with skills
and knowledge to improve their health-related and skills-related fitness, and to
participate in physical activities safely. In order to promote lifelong participation in
physical activities for physical health, students will be guided to develop and
implement their training plans.
The Physical Fitness strand seeks to promote students’ enjoyment in physical activities
towards active lifestyle. It includes a fitness and conditioning component (about 8
hours per level) where students are introduced to the essential skills and knowledge
required for running and resistance exercises using body weight. At Secondary 1 and
2, the component focuses on running and resistance exercise using body weight. At
Secondary 3 and 4, the component aims to introduce students to other types of
cardiovascular exercises and execute resistance exercises using body weight that
involve a combination of movements.
b. Safety and Risk Management
The strand on Safety and Risk Management seeks to instil in our students a safety
mindset when they participate in activities. Students apply the skills and knowledge
to be able to participate in physical activities safely, for example to assess and manage
the risks and respond to emergencies. At the secondary level, students are able to
assess and manage risks in more complex situations and while planning physical
activities. Students learn to respond and manage emergencies as they learn about
simple first aid and CPR-AED protocols.
c. Nutrition
Through the strand on Nutrition, students learn about the nutritional requirements in
relation to exercise and participation in physical activities. Building on the knowledge
155
OFFICIAL (CLOSED) / NON-SENSITIVE
FOR USE BY EDUCATION OFFICERS ONLY

from Food and Consumer Education (FCE) in Secondary 1 and 2, students understand
the importance of macronutrients and micronutrients to which are necessary for
participation in and recovery after physical activities. They discuss topics such as
alternative diets, supplement intake and intake of sports drinks. Students will be
equipped with the skills and knowledge to make informed decisions in relation to
healthy eating, which is an important component towards healthy living.
d. Personal Hygiene and Self-Care
At the secondary level, this strand focuses on Self-Care rather than Personal Hygiene.
Through the strand, students are introduced to the skills and knowledge essential to
maintain physical health such as regular physical activity including limiting sedentary
activities, nutrition, and sufficient sleep. Students will be able to apply the skills and
knowledge to make informed decisions related to physical health in their daily life. To
facilitate lifelong active and healthy living, students identify strategies and are
equipped with the skills to work towards healthier behaviours and habits. In order for
students to better appreciate the importance of health-enhancing behaviours, the
syllabus takes into account the behaviours that are more relevant to students’ current
stage of life, for example, sleep and healthy eating when eating out.

APPLICATION OF LEARNING IN AUTHENTIC CONTEXT
Students will apply the skills and knowledge to make informed decisions related to physical
health in their daily life. They will be guided to develop and enact the following:
•
•

An exercise plan to achieve personal goal for physical health in Secondary 2
An action plan to form a health practice(s) towards healthier behaviour(s) in
Secondary 4

At Secondary 2, students develop an exercise plan to achieve a personalised goal for physical
health. In developing the plan, students will apply skills and knowledge on types of exercises,
FITT principle, risk assessment and strategies such as goal setting, action planning and
monitoring their improvement to work towards their target.
At Secondary 4, students apply the skills and knowledge to develop and enact an action plan
to work to form a health practice(s) towards healthier behaviour(s). Based on their concerns
or interests, students decide on the health behaviour (e.g., regular physical activities or eat a
healthy diet) they want to pursue. They develop a plan where they set their goal related to
the behaviour, plan the actions and monitor their progress, apply the knowledge that they
have learnt in Physical Health and Safety (e.g., principles of training and methods of training
to build physical fitness, healthy nutrition, safety and risk management) and identify ways to
overcome barriers that they come across when enacting the plan. They are also able to discuss
with their friends on strategies on how to sustain the behaviour. Through the culminating
activity, students experience the process which they can adopt to form a health habit.
Through the positive experiences, students’ confidence in their skills and knowledge is
reinforced. This builds their self-efficacy in enacting the practices of an active and healthy
lifestyle.

3.3 Character and Citizenship Education Developmental
Milestones (Secondary Level)
In this Physical Education syllabus, learning outcomes are identified for each core value,
presented in the form of related social-emotional competencies (as Developmental
Milestones). Teachers consciously plan for progressive learning experiences where students
are able to put competencies into practice over a sustained period of learning, leading to the
development of core values. The Physical Education lesson primarily focuses on the
psychomotor and cognitive outcomes. Thereafter, the affective outcomes are appropriately
layered over the physical activities, while maintaining high physical and cognitive engagement
time.
These Developmental Milestones are not intended to be benchmarks for evaluation purposes
but as reference points for coordination and alignment in Character and Citizenship Education
efforts to achieve coherence across subjects and learning experiences in schools.

4. PRE-UNIVERSITY LEVEL SYLLABUS CONTENT
4.1 Overview
KEY ATTRIBUTES OF STUDENTS AND LEARNING EXPERIENCES
The purpose of Physical Education is to enable students to demonstrate individually and with
others, the skills, knowledge practices and values to enjoy a lifetime of active healthy living.
For students to achieve the purpose of Physical Education, the journey continues with the
pre-university Physical Education curriculum, which aims to develop Committed Participants
who demonstrate a conscious decision and action to pursue personal excellence, and are a
role-model to their family and friends in leading an active and healthy lifestyle.
The pre-university Physical Education curriculum further improves the students’ existing skills
and knowledge to a higher level of performance excellence as set against the self-established
standards in physical activities. The key difference between the secondary and pre-university
curriculum content is therefore differentiated not by the higher skills to be taught, as
stipulated in the syllabus per se, but more by an individual’s desire to learn these skills to
enhance their performance and enjoy the activity. Students will also continue to broaden their
learning of healthy practices and knowledge to further develop them into individuals who
exemplify the pursuit of an active, healthy lifestyle.
Recognising the fact that students progressing to the pre-university level will have varied
experiences across a range of specialised situations and physical activities, schools will have
the flexibility and autonomy to enact the pre-university Physical Education syllabus to achieve
the outcomes of Physical Education. Through well-organised learning experiences in the
different learning areas, students focus on improving their performance and being a role
model for active, healthy living to become Committed Participants.

The Learning Outcomes (LOs) in the two learning areas for the pre-university level build on
the movement capacity and knowledge that were learnt at the primary and secondary levels.
The LOs for Physical Health and Safety specify minimally what students should know and be
able to do by the end of pre-university. For Physical Activities, the LOs are premised on the
expected student competence in a recreational context.

APPLICATION OF LEARNING IN AUTHENTIC CONTEXT
By the end of Pre-university 2/3, students will have experienced at least 1 recreational
competition organised by the school. In addition, they will have experienced developing and
enacting a plan for self or others to work towards a healthier lifestyle.

4.2 Learning Areas
Physical Activity
Physical Activities provide the contexts for students to display various fundamental
movement skills, either individually or in combination that they have learnt at the primary
and secondary levels. Students will draw on early experiences and develop, with
confidence, mature patterns that they can display and perform at a recreational
competition level. In Games and Sports, games-related concepts and strategies are
consciously weaved into appropriate game situations, together with an emphasis on the
learning and demonstration of values like integrity, respect and resilience. This emphasis
extends to other categories of physical activities like Athletics and Swimming, where skills
and concepts are taught in tandem with values. For these physical activities, students are
encouraged to participate in challenges that increase their personal performances by
testing themselves against their peers in non-competitive contexts where the focus
remains on improving one’s personal best. Students make use of the experiences that they
have gained through the active participation in physical activities and be motivated to lead
an active and healthy lifestyle.

PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES OFFERINGS
At the Pre-University level, students are given the opportunity to revisit physical activities that
they have learnt at the Secondary level or pick up new physical activities. They should be given
opportunity to participate in physical activities, which are individual, dual or team in nature,
of their choice. Since students would have basic competencies which they acquired by the
end of secondary school, students would be refining their skills or working towards learning
higher level skills in the physical activity that they are revisiting while seeking to achieve the
same learning outcomes. Besides this, students may progress to play the actual format of the
game. Through differentiated instructions, students who are learning new physical activities
will be guided on the basic skills and concept of the game before they experience a
recreational competition.

PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES GUIDELINES
The physical activities offered by the schools should fulfil the following guidelines:
•
•
•
•

Schools should offer at least five physical activities for every student.
Students should participate in at least one activity that is individual/dual in nature and
a team activity.
Students should be given the opportunity to select from a range of activities provided
by the school.
Students should have at least one recreational competition experience during their
pre-university education.

In addition to the above guidelines, the following must be taken into consideration in the
delivery of the physical activities:
•
•
•
•

have at least 10 hours of curriculum time
include learning outcomes which are aligned to the five goals of Physical Education
have a culminating event (either through an end-state game or achieving a target set)
incorporate fitness component such as relevant resistance exercises using body
weight and safety practices for students to apply their learning in the Physical Health
and Safety learning area

Schools can offer physical activities that are not listed in the syllabus document (see Table 15)
as long as the design of the physical activity adheres to the requirements above. In designing
the school-based physical activity LOs, the school has to ensure the following:

•
•
•

The LOs have the level of demand equivalent to the LOs for the physical activities listed
in the syllabus document.
All games-related concepts within the games category are adopted. (For Games only)
The content is tailored to students’ ability, involving skills and knowledge (e.g.,
complexity of skills, techniques or tactical / strategic /compositional elements).
The culminating event allows students to extend their skills applications and can
mirror game format in the full game setting (e.g., 7v7 Football with goalkeeper, 6v6
Volleyball, 7v7 Netball).

GAMES-RELATED CONCEPTS AND SKILLS
Games-related concepts73 are introduced to students through modified games at the upper
primary and reinforced at the secondary levels. Both fundamental and specialised skills and
movement concepts are required in playing these games. In this syllabus, games are classified
into the following categories:
•
•
•

net-barrier
striking-fielding
territorial-invasion

Within each game category, there are games-related concepts that are transferrable across
games within the same category. Game-specific skills are also identified for selected games
for the learning area of Physical Activities. Table 16 describes the main intention of the game
category and the games-related concepts across the three game categories. Questions in
italics style can foster critical thinking and problem solving among the students. When done
appropriately, these questions also help students to identify the games-related concepts and
skills required.

Table 16. Games-related Concepts and Skills

APPLICATION OF LEARNING IN AUTHENTIC CONTEXT
By the end of Pre-University 2/3, students will have experienced at least 1 recreational
competition organised by the school. Competition provides a platform for students to apply
the skills and values learnt during Physical Education lessons in an authentic context. This
inclusion is not to propel all students towards playing competitive sports. Instead, it serves as
an important platform to expose our students to real-life sports settings and in the process
acquire relevant 21st Century Competencies to cope with the fast-changing world.
Competition mirrors life. One works as an individual or in a team towards a common goal,
handling stress and pressure, celebrating success, bouncing back from failures, and etc.
Participation in competitions can help students recognise their strengths and weaknesses,
learn to collaborate and communicate with others, develop adaptive thinking through
responding to and creating solutions in unexpected or difficult situations, and build resilience
in handling ups and downs. While the stress and pressure to win may pose a challenge to
some students, it will serve as a good opportunity to teach our students to be confident of
their own abilities and better handle winning and losing.
To help students enjoy and reap the benefits of the competition experience, a teacher will
have to be mindful of structuring Physical Education lessons appropriately to create a positive
learning environment. They should constantly emphasise doing one’s best in practice tasks
and in competition to highlight that the process is more important and meaningful than

achieving the outcome. More importantly, a teacher should make good use of the opportunity
to introduce appropriate skills to help students develop 21st Century Competencies.
Recreational competitions are at intra-school level and students can participate in with their
classmates. Rules and competition formats are modified to cater to their skill levels. Team
compositions will be smaller so that play time can be longer, and more students can
participate. The format of the competition can also comprise groupings of similar ability
where students will have opportunities to play at least 3 matches in their assigned grouping.
There is no need for the lead up to an overall champion.

Badminton*
DESCRIPTION OF THE GAME
Students play a singles badminton game, with appropriate rules.
During game play, students execute skills of foot work, service and shuttle control, as well as a
combination of skills with good form to achieve the intended outcomes. Application of good
footwork to support swift movement in court is fundamental in sustaining the rallies to ultimately
apply tactical strategies. In offence, students exploit space to create attacking opportunities or
capitalise on mistakes made by opponents to win a point. In defence, students cover available court
space adequately to limit opponents’ offensive attack as well as returning the shuttle to place the
opponents in a less advantageous offensive position.

DESCRIPTION OF THE GAME
Students play a 3v3 half-court basketball game, with appropriate rules.
During game play, students execute skills of passing, dribbling, and shooting, as well as a
combination of skills with good form to achieve the intended outcomes. They also apply good
footwork to change speed and direction, stop in balance, and pivot when enacting offensive and
defensive strategies. Passing accurately to teammates is key to advancing the ball while maintaining
possession. In attacking the basket, students make use of available space to penetrate the defence
and support teammate to score, or create space to set up attacking opportunities if none is obvious.
In defending the basket, the team works together to slow down an attack by guarding the attackers,
denying attacking space, preventing scoring and attempting to regain possession of the ball.

Floorball*
DESCRIPTION OF THE GAME
Students play a 4v4 floorball game without goalkeeper, with appropriate rules.
During game play, students execute skills of dribbling, passing, shooting and moving off the ball, as
well as a combination of skills with good form to achieve the intended outcomes. Students
demonstrate good control and balance when dribbling and passing to set up opportunities for
themselves and teammates to shoot at goal when enacting offensive strategies. They are able to
adjust their positions to keep frontal view of the goal post when attacking. In attacking the goal,
students make good use of available space to penetrate the defence or create space to set up
attacking opportunities for teammates to score. In defending the goal, students place themselves
between the attacker and goal post and work together to slow down the attacking line, deny
attacking space, prevent scoring and regain possession of the ball.

DESCRIPTION OF THE GAME
Students play a 4v4 rugby game without scrummaging, tackling and mauling, with appropriate
rules.
During game play, student execute skills of catching and passing, evasive running, scoring and
defending as well as a combination of skills with good form to achieve the intended outcomes.
Students demonstrate adequate ball handling skills, evasive running and spatial awareness that
guides students’ decision-making ability to score points. The attacking team is allowed to pass the
ball sideways or backwards while running forward to score by placing the ball in the score zone (try
line). Upon being tagged, the ball carrier must stop and pass the ball to a teammate to carry on with
play and attempt to score. In defence, students apply pressure on the ball carrier to delay invasion,
deny space and opportunities to score by tracking and tagging ball carriers, and regain possession
of the ball.

DESCRIPTION OF THE GAME
Students play a 5v5 territorial game using a flying disc, with appropriate rules.
During game play, students are able to apply or combine throwing and catching skills to attack the
end-zone goal. They are also able to demonstrate good footwork to change directions through
pivoting and stopping with balance in both offensive and defensive situations. In attacking the endzone goal, students are able to work with teammates through creating space and penetrating
defence to set up offensive opportunities. In defending the end-zone, students work with
teammates to deny space for invasion through person-to-person defence, prevent scoring and
attempting to regain possession of the disc. Students would also be able to self-referee their game
play and be responsible for adhering to and overseeing the rules themselves.

Physical Health and Safety
Physical Health and Safety stimulates students’ interest in physical activity as meaningful
connections between health concepts and practical applications are made through
experiential learning. Through authentic learning experiences, students develop an
understanding in physical health concepts, healthy and active living, safe practices, and
personal hygiene. They pursue physical activities that interest them regularly and safely,
make healthier food choices and take care of themselves. Building on the knowledge, skills
and learning experiences, students learn to evaluate their lifestyles and work towards
healthier behaviours. As students mature, they build the commitment to lead an active and
heathy lifestyle and encourage others to do so.

PHYSICAL HEALTH AND SAFETY STRANDS
The content areas are organised under the four strands, namely: (a) Physical Fitness, (b)
Safety and Risk Management, (c) Nutrition, and (d) Personal Hygiene and Self-Care. Through
the four strands, students develop an understanding of physical health concepts, healthy and
active living, safe practices, and personal hygiene. With the understanding, students apply
the skills and knowledge to participate in physical activities regularly and safely, make
healthier food choices and take care of themselves, developing a sense of personal
responsibility towards active and healthy living. Students make connections between what
they have learn in class and their environment to exhibit health-enhancing behaviours and
work towards sustained commitment in safe, active and healthy lifestyles. To better facilitate
students making the connections, some of the learning outcomes for safety and physical
fitness are integrated into the Physical Activities learning areas.
a. Physical Fitness
Physical fitness refers to the ability of the body systems to work together efficiently
to allow one to be healthy and perform activities of daily living. Through this strand,
students apply the skills and knowledge to improve their health-related and skillsrelated fitnessand to participate in physical activities safely. Students are aware of the
benefits of physical activities to health, factors that contribute to their personal
enjoyment of being active and activities that can support their participation in physical
activity throughout their lives. With the awareness and knowledge, they can
subsequently influence family and friends towards an active and healthy lifestyle.
The Physical Fitness strand includes a fitness and conditioning component (about 8
hours per level) where students experience various types of cardiovascular and
resistance exercises. Through the process, students identify the activities which they
can do and enjoy.
b. Safety and Risk Management
The strand on Safety and Risk Management seeks to instil in our students a safety
mindset when they participate in activities. Students apply the skills and knowledge
to participate in physical activities safely. At the pre-university level, students are able
to assess and manage risks in more complex situations and while planning physical
activities.
c. Nutrition
Tapping on the skills and knowledge learnt from primary and secondary levels,
students discuss issues related to performance enhancing supplements, alternative
diets and eating disorders. Students are able to discern information related to
nutrition and make informed decisions in relation to health.

204

d. Personal Hygiene and Self-Care
At the pre-university level, this strand focuses on Self-Care rather than Personal
Hygiene. Students learn how to lead an active and healthy lifestyle as a resource to
maintain physical health. They understand the importance of demonstrating healthenhancing behaviours such as regular participation in physical activity including
limiting sedentary activities, nutrition, and having sufficient sleep to maintain physical
health. Students will be able to apply the skills and knowledge to make informed
decisions related to physical health in their daily life. Students discuss and identify
strategies that help them work towards healthier behaviours and habit formation.
They understand that habit changes with different life contexts and situations, and are
aware of the strategies that can help them form positive habits.

APPLICATION OF LEARNING IN AUTHENTIC CONTEXT
To strengthen students’ commitment to lead active and healthy lifestyle, they will develop
and enact an action plan for self or others to work towards a healthier lifestyle by the end of
Pre-University 2/3.
At the pre-university level, students apply the skills and knowledge to develop and enact an
action plan to work towards a healthier lifestyle. Students decide on a specific area (e.g.,
improving fitness, regular physical activities or healthy diet) they want to act on. They develop
a plan where they set their goal, plan the actions, apply the knowledge that they have learnt
(e.g., principles of training and methods of training to build physical fitness, healthy nutrition,
safety and risk management), monitor their progress and identify ways to overcome barriers
that they come across when enacting the plan. They reflect on their progress and discuss with
their friends on ways which they can sustain the behaviour to achieve or maintain their health
goal. Through the culminating activity, students experience the process which they can adopt
to form a habit. Through the positive experiences, students’ confidence in their skills and
knowledge is reinforced. This builds their self-efficacy in enacting the practices of an active
and healthy lifestyle and provides them with the confidence and commitment to follow
through their plan.

4.3 Character and Citizenship Education Developmental
Milestones (Pre-University Level)
In this Physical Education syllabus, learning outcomes are identified for each core value,
presented in the form of related social-emotional competencies (as Developmental
Milestones). Teachers consciously plan for progressive learning experiences where students
are able to put competencies into practice over a sustained period of learning, leading to the
development of core values. The Physical Education lesson primarily focuses on the
psychomotor and cognitive outcomes. Thereafter, the affective outcomes are appropriately
layered over the physical activities, while maintaining high physical and cognitive engagement
time.
These Developmental Milestones are not intended to be benchmarks for evaluation purposes
but as reference points for coordination and alignment in Character and Citizenship Education
efforts to achieve coherence across subjects and learning experiences in schools.

PEDAGOGY

SINGAPORE CURRICULUM PHILOSOPHY AND SINGAPORE TEACHING PRACTICES
The Singapore Curriculum Philosophy (SCP) and Singapore Teaching Practice (STP) guide the
beliefs and processes of learning, teaching and assessment in Physical Education.
Placing students’ interest and needs at heart, the SCP leads Physical Education teachers to
think about the teaching and learning of the curriculum. Taking reference from SCP, Physical
Education teachers:
•
•
•
•

believe in holistic education
believe that every child wants to learn and can learn
focus on students’ learning needs when designing learning experiences
believe that learning flourishes:
o
o
o
o

in caring and safe environments
when students construct knowledge actively
through the development of thinking skills and dispositions
when assessment is used to address students’ learning gaps

The STP then draws on these beliefs about how students learn and teachers teach. It
articulates the importance of understanding the subject’s knowledge bases deeply and the
pedagogical practices that lead to engaged learning. Physical Education teachers should use
these beliefs, the knowledge bases (e.g., Physical Education Teaching and Learning Syllabus)
and pedagogical practices when planning and enacting lesson ideas to enhance the learning
experiences of the students, by helping students find more meaning and make connections
in the skills, knowledge and practices gained through the curriculum.
The Pedagogical Practices of STP outlines four fundamental Teaching Processes that make
explicit what teachers reflect on and put into practice before, during and after their
interaction with students in all learning contexts. The Teaching Processes are as follows:
•
•
•
•

Positive Classroom Culture
Lesson Preparation
Lesson Enactment
Assessment and Feedback

PHYSICAL EDUCATION LESSON OBSERVATION TOOL
The Physical Education Lesson Observation Tool (PELOT)82 is a reliable knowledge base of
pedagogical strategies. It combines research- and practice-based indicators of effective
planning and instructional behaviours that characterise effective Physical Education teachers.
This developmental tool aims to support their reflective practice, foster collaborative lesson

observations and mentoring culture, and guide professional discourses to promote a teacherled culture of continuing professional development.
PELOT articulates the four Teaching Processes and are subsequently unpacked to the 24
Teaching Areas for Physical Education. The updated PELOT+ Blended Learning (PELOT+BL)
includes planning considerations for blended learning and tapping on information and
communications technology (ICT) affordances for learning in PE. This codification of effective
teaching and learning beliefs, knowledge bases and pedagogical practices allows teachers,
including Physical Education and classroom-based subjects teacher colleagues to have a
common language for discourse. Repeated and deliberate use of PELOT to objectively
examine the strengths and areas for growth in the teaching practice hones the craft of
teaching.

UNDERSTANDING STUDENTS
It's not a particular instructional method or script that will make a difference in
student learning. It’s about getting more precise on how students are
progressing in their learning and then using that information to personalise
learning. It’s about choosing the strategy that will work best for a given learner
at a given time.83
In planning an effective lesson for students, teachers need to make crucial considerations
around content, pedagogy and assessment (refer to the Teaching Process of Lesson
Preparation in STP for elaboration). One of its Teaching Areas, Considering Learners’ Profiles,
emphasises the importance of making lesson design decisions based on the information
teachers have about their students.
Knowing the profiles of students enables teachers to determine if the differentiation of
content, process, product, or environment is necessary and the extent of differentiation
required. Differentiated Instruction (DI) is “a teacher’s planned and adaptive response to
meet the diverse learning needs of all students in order to maximise their progress in
learning”. Undergirded by the STP, the four DI guidelines are:
•
•
•
•

Understand the students
Focus on subject disciplinarity
Address the needs of all students
Assessment for learning

Students with Special Educational Needs
Students with Special Educational Needs (SEN) form part of the varied student segments. Like
all other student segments, they can equally benefit from PE lessons that are designed with
their diverse needs in mind. As with all other students, there is a broad spectrum amongst
students with SEN, and their level of needs may change over time and across different
contexts. Generally, the needs of students with SEN come under four broad categories of
83 Hattie (2009)

212
OFFICIAL (CLOSED) / NON-SENSITIVE
FOR USE BY EDUCATION OFFICERS ONLY

Learning, Physical, Social-behavioural and Sensory needs. Knowing the profiles of these
students enables teachers to determine the type and extent of differentiation required to
improve access to learning and participation during lessons.

PEDAGOGICAL APPROACHES AND STRATEGIES
Based on strong knowledge and clear understanding of students, the Physical Education
teacher will then employ the most appropriate Physical Education-specific pedagogical
approach or strategy to best meet the learning needs and outcomes. Through such efforts,
every student will feel included in, and involved with, the lesson. Values, social-emotional
competencies and emerging 21st century competencies are also intentionally developed
through effective pedagogy.

Mosston’s Spectrum of Teaching Styles
The Mosston’s Spectrum of Teaching Styles framework84 describes 11 interconnected
teaching styles which systematically and progressively devolve decision-making to students.
The spectrum reminds us of the value in selecting appropriate teaching approaches. The styles
(from A to K) are listed in Table 17. The first five teaching styles A to E form the reproduction
cluster. In these styles, students learn by reproducing or replicating what the teacher expects
them to do. For example, the teacher demonstrates a balance in a gymnastics lesson and the
students follow exactly what the teacher does. The teacher expects the students to reproduce
known knowledge and/or skills.
Between the reproduction and production cluster, the discovery threshold demarcates the
two clusters. Teaching styles F to K are in the production cluster of teaching styles. In these
styles students are facilitated by the teacher to discover new knowledge and/or skills, for
example, to produce a movement that is unknown to them based on a question or problem
posed to them. They engage in cognitive operations that evoke critical thinking, curiosity,
exploration, and discovery of knowledge that they engage in on their own. Using gymnastics
balance as an example, with the teacher posing an instruction to explore different ways of
balancing using three body parts, students will then explore and experiment on their own
with as many balance poses as they can.

Teaching Styles

Movement Education
In movement education, Rudolf Laban’s framework is used to analyse movement and teach
the skills and movement concepts within dance, gymnastics, and even games. Laban’s
conceptual framework includes the following four aspects of movement concepts:
•
•

the body aspect describes what the body is doing and the shape of the body
the space aspects describe where in space the body moves
214
OFFICIAL (CLOSED) / NON-SENSITIVE
FOR USE BY EDUCATION OFFICERS ONLY

•
•

the effort aspect describes how the body moves
the relationship aspect consists of the relationship between the body or body parts
and the equipment or apparatus, between individuals, and among individuals in
groups

The focus is on developing skill and movement variety. All tasks have a specific goal for
improving some aspects of children’s movement and knowledge within the games,
gymnastics, dance, and health-related physical activity content areas85. Physical Education
teachers select the content and design tasks to meet the lesson objectives and desired
learning outcomes. Small-stepped progression is planned within a lesson and across the unit
so that students are able to perform the culminating activity such as a dance or gymnastics
sequence at the end of a unit. In the learning of games and sport, specifically in relation to
net-wall barrier, territorial-invasion, striking-fielding, the teacher can provide appropriate and
variable situations for practising the skill or tactic, and modify games to be small-sided to
match students’ developmental levels.

Game-Based Approach
The Game-Based Approach (GBA) 86 is a constructivist approach to teaching of games. It is a
common term used to represent the various approaches such as Teaching Games for
Understanding (TGfU), Tactical Games Approach, Game Sense and Games Concept Approach
which share similar philosophies, principles and goals87.
Based on the belief that engagement is higher if students appreciate the game and
understand the relevance of a particular skill in a specific game situation, the ‘what’, ‘why’
and ‘when’ in a game are addressed and takes precedence, before the ‘how’. Physical
Education teachers use the game as the platform where tactical understanding and decisionmaking skills are taught, and where skills are learnt in context. The game is selected and
modified based on the principles of sampling, representation, exaggeration and tactical
complexity88.
In GBA, the teacher plays the role of a facilitator by guiding students’ learning through
questioning and manipulation of task constraints, so that they inquire and make links to what
they already know. When well-designed, the approach has the potential to engage students
of different ability levels through developmentally appropriate modified games and
contextualised skills practice, focused on solving the embedded tactical problems.

Place-Responsive Pedagogy
Specific to Outdoor Education, the place-responsive pedagogical framework (adapted from
Demarest, 2015; Wattchow & Brown, 2011) guides PE teachers in their understanding of how
place is relevant to learning and to identify its affordances. The connection with places is built
85 Rovegno & Bandhauer (2017)
86 In order to promote the use of a common language and avoid confusion among scholars and practitioners, the TGfU

International Advisory Committee released a consensus statement in 2021 on the use of the term Game-Based Approach.

through the five pedagogical foci outlined in the framework, starting with Being present in
and with places. As developing connections is often a dynamic process, these foci do not exist
in a linear fashion; rather, they are meant to be taught in a spiral and progressive manner.
The teacher can even design a lesson that engages more than one pedagogical focus. Through
these pedagogical foci, we hope that teachers and students will not treat the place of learning
merely as a backdrop and provide sufficient time for students to connect with places and
nature. A specific example of an understanding of how to develop a sense of place during OE
in PE lessons would be to get students to engage in wayfinding around the school, while
spending time to interact with the school and its community, thereby, building personal
connections with the school. In this example, the navigation activity comes alive with
memories of the place, stories of people, and observations of flora and fauna. Using the
framework, PE teachers can consider ways to empower students in discovering the
distinctiveness of places and to build personal connections with these places during their
exploration.
PE teachers should design repeated engaging experiences in the place to strengthen students’
understanding about the place. Such experiences allow students to process their emotions
and make sense of new knowledge by asking critical questions and making connections to
their prior knowledge, concepts, and ideas. Students also learn to ascribe personal meanings
to the place and represent their experiences through various modes of expression such as
dance, nature art, poetry, infographics, and song. The teacher plays a significant role in
facilitating students to find relevance, meaning and purpose through their place-responsive
learning experiences and develop their attachment to the place. Over time, students will
deepen their desire to connect with places and its community and contribute to them. An
elaboration on how PE teachers can engage students in learning to develop personal
connections with place through the five pedagogical foci is summarized in Table 18. It outlines
some considerations on how to progressively develop students’ personal connection with
places across the school years.

Nonlinear Pedagogy
The Nonlinear Pedagogy (NLP) is underpinned by the understanding that views students as
open complex systems where goal-directed behaviours emerge as a consequence of the
interactions among constraints such as their own ability, the task at hand and environment
they are in. Specifically, NLP encourages learners to explore movement solutions that are
individualised and based on the task, performer and environmental constraints in the learning
environment.
In NLP, the design of student-centric learning environments is critical. Lessons are designed
that incorporate principles of representativeness, manipulation of constraints, attentional
focus, functional variability that allows learners to explore, search and exploit movement
possibilities89. The manipulation of constraints (e.g., task constraints that include instructions,
equipment and task goals) encourages the students to perceive the situation, and derive their
own desired movements or behaviours. The key is in encouraging learners to explore their
own ways to solve movement challenges where there may not be only one movement
solution. When employing this approach, a consideration can be on helping the learner
explore a movement outcome (or movement form) that is functional for the individual
learner.

Experiential Learning Approach
Experiential Learning Theory defines learning as “the process whereby knowledge is created
through the transformation of experience” (Kolb, 1984, p.41). Using this pedagogical
approach, PE teachers facilitate students through a process involving experiencing, reflecting,
thinking and acting to transform their experiences into learning (see Table 19). As such,
students are actively engaged in identifying and solving problems, making decisions,
understanding and drawing connections from the experience (Knapp, 2010). A specific
example of how to use experiential learning approach during OE in PE lessons would be during
the outdoor cooking modules where students learn to start a fire safely in school. They learn
ways to select a site, plan their meal, decide their roles and responsibilities, start the fire
safely, cook a dish and clean up the area. Over the series of lessons, they observe ways of
doing things more effectively through practice. The teacher plays a significant role in
facilitating reflection which involves constantly re-visiting students’ understanding, sense
making and drawing connections from their past to new experiences. As a result, students
gain more experience and expertise to apply to other contexts such as cohort camps and
enjoy recreational outdoor participation. This eventually leads to a deeper understanding
about the OE concept.

Table 19. An Overview on the Key Roles of Teacher and Students in the Experiential Learning
Approach (Kolb, 1984)

Inquiry-Based Learning Approach
Inquiry-based learning (IBL) emphasises active participation and learner’s responsibility for
discovering knowledge that is new to the learner90. In IBL, teachers empower students to ask
meaningful questions and use evidence to address problems. As students pose their own
questions, their curiosity is piqued and as a result, they are more engaged in the learning
process. IBL seeks to foster students’ curiosity, voice and agency for them to be self-directed
lifelong learners, and helps to develop in them 21st century competencies such as
collaborative and critical thinking skills.
Through IBL, students can have the opportunity to:
•
•
•
•
•

formulate the questions, and gather and organise relevant information
interpret and analyse information to identify relationships, make connections and
potentially construct new knowledge
evaluate and draw conclusions by synthesising the information and make informed
decisions
collaborate with others to deepen their learning and communicate clearly and
effectively the information in writing or through demonstration and performance
reflect on the initial questions and the learning and what could have done differently,
and transfer the learning to new situations

Depending on students’ readiness, prior knowledge and skills to learn, teachers can choose
to adopt an open inquiry or more structured inquiry. In this way, teachers are able to adjust
the degree of autonomy which students have in posing and responding to questions,
designing investigations, and evaluating and communicating their learning. Thus, while

teachers are facilitators of learning in IBL, depending on the readiness of students, they may
need to provide more structured support to guide students.
While learning games concept and tactics through modified versions of the games or
activities, students explore and investigate the games situations, discuss and analyse the
tactics, enact the most feasible solution, and transfer the learnings to other games situations.
In learning areas like Physical Health and Safety, students analyse and make sense of the
information and data that they gathered or provided by the teacher. They draw conclusions
and explain their decisions and choices on the possible impacts to themselves, and others.

Direct Instruction
There are situations that call for a more direct approach to giving instructions for learning.
Direct instruction is characterised by the following features:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Task-oriented with clear goals
Tasks are structured and designed around skills that are broken down to parts so that
students can experience success
Highly active teaching
Appropriate demonstration accompanied by clear instruction to illustrate learning
tasks
Highly active monitoring of student progress
Immediate and specific feedback

In direct instruction, teachers have a full control over what the students learn and how they
will learn. It is most commonly applied when the content is hierarchical, involving basic skills
and maximum practice time is paramount to ensure safety and efficiency of learning.
The fundamental choice of adopting any pedagogical approaches and strategies again lies in
the understanding of students’ needs and the attainment of learning outcomes at that
specific moment of the learning experience.

LEVERAGING AFFECTIVE LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES
Besides adopting the pedagogical approach, there is a need for teachers to have an organising
frame to leverage the numerous affective and 21CC learning opportunities that present
themselves in the various learning areas in the Physical Education lesson. The five affective
learning opportunities (refer Table 2091) are presented to help teachers identify, plan and
thereafter deliver the lesson with the appropriate teacher practice and teaching strategies.

Establish a positive teacher-student relationship
Encourage positive student-student relationships
Facilitate reflection through questions that help your students
consider how they or others feel about the situation, the impact
and appropriateness of their actions or the actions of others, and
their next course of action
Give positive reinforcement of success in learning, e.g., be specific
when offering praise so that your students understand why they
are receiving it; extend the use of terms like “good job” or “that’s
wonderful” with an elaboration why it is so good or wonderful

Consider the planned tasks and predict possible teachable
moments based on your experience, so that you are better able to
recognise and use them when they occur
While many teachers highlight negative teachable moments, e.g.,
upon noticing that a student was ‘cutting-corners’, the teacher
stepped in and addressed the integrity issue, it is just as important
to highlight positive ones, e.g., upon spotting a conflict resolved
amicably between two students during a small-sided game, the
teacher stepped in to address the situation by affirming and
advocating pro-social behaviour
Ensure that learning within a teachable moment is facilitated, e.g.,
draw attention to the expected behaviour, ask your students to
identify the desired behaviour and state why it is desired, highlight
links between skills and values within the moment and with
application to real life

Table 20. Affective Learning Opportunities

USE OF TECHNOLOGY IN LEARNING
In addition to the various pedagogical approaches highlighted, the current educational
landscape has demonstrated that technology has the potential to provide a more
personalised, and reflective learning experiences to help students achieve an active and
healthy living in and out of the classroom. Where appropriate, Physical Education teachers
are encouraged to leverage the affordances of technology to complement the learning in
Physical Education and support the development of healthy practices amongst students.
These affordances should be effective in meeting the needs of the lesson design while
ensuring the level of physicality is maintained during the learning and taking into
consideration students’ readiness to harness the benefits of these affordances. For students
to fully benefit from these learning experiences, teachers should exercise their professional
judgement when selecting, modifying, and adapting resources, and the integration of
technology during the design of learning.
The Student Learning Space (SLS) provides the key platform where students’ pace of learning
and different interaction (e.g., student-content, student-student) can transit seamlessly
between the different contexts (e.g., classroom and home). Teachers can access SLS to search
for relevant learning resources to complement their teaching or customise these resources
to suit their students’ learning needs. Teachers are encouraged to design active learning
which leverages the Key Application of Technology (KAT) to reimagine the different elements
of learning such as Personalisation, Learning Together, Assessment for Learning and
Differentiation. With SLS as the key platform, teachers can also explore other readily available
tools to support the different KAT identified. For example, online collaboration tools can be
used by teachers to facilitate students’ participation in discussion about their performances
in the various learning areas. Video tools can also help students provide timely feedback
about performances to their peers during learning as part of assessment for learning.

In an increasingly digitised world, technology is often used to support active and healthy
practices, and health information is also readily available, it is important that our students are
critical and responsible users of digital technologies to support them in their journey to lead
an active and healthy life. Physical Teachers are encouraged to design varied authentic
learning experiences to help students continuously refine strategies to critically gather and
evaluate information (e.g., evaluating credibility of a new diet fad) and use digital tools (e.g.,
selecting a new fitness app) in a safe and responsible manner.

ASSESSMENT

PURPOSE
The purpose of assessment is to provide information for making an informed judgement
about what students know and are able to do in order to help them progress towards
attaining the goals of Physical Education.
Assessment is integral to the learning process; an iterative and continuous process that
teachers’ employ to be informed of students’ learning progress and to inform students of
their learning. Students play a crucial role in assessment. In the assessment process, students
importantly, participate in the process of metacognition; reflect on and monitor their learning
progress to play an active role their learning.
The overarching aim of on-going assessments is to impact teaching and learning. Importantly,
the purpose of assessment is to make informed judgements about what students know and
can do. Thus, allowing teachers to progress students in their learning. For example, teachers
can and should guide students in and during self-and peer-assessments. Notably, the use of
on-going assessments provides teachers with information to identify learning gaps92. With
the assessment data, teachers can plan and adapt future lessons to address students’ learning
gaps. Hence, moving students’ learning forward.
Teachers should work towards ensuring that assessments are:
•
•
•

integrated into teaching and learning
a continuous process and done throughout the unit
purposeful and meaningful in the teaching and learning process

The use of purposeful on-going assessments allows teachers to recognise students’ strengths
across the various learning areas and identify areas to improve. Importantly, teachers should
not conduct assessments solely for reporting purposes. Assessment should be incorporated
as part of the lesson. It is also useful for students to have opportunity to review their
performance in the learning process. Time spent on assessment during Physical Education
should be meaningful to make a difference in students’ learning. Thus, when done well,
assessment can provide students with a greater ownership in their learning and promote the
joy of learning through increasing students’ motivation to learn.
These outcomes reflect the vision of assessment in the Singapore Teaching Practice that
learning flourishes when assessments are used in a developmentally appropriate manner to
address learning gaps.

PRINCIPLES
There are four main guiding principles in setting the direction for on-going assessment in
Physical Education. In essence, assessments in Physical Education must:
a. Align to Singapore Curriculum Philosophy
• be integrated in the learning process
• begin with clarity of purpose
• gather information to inform practice and future lesson design
b. Support enactment of the Physical Education syllabus
• align with the purpose and five goals of Physical Education
• extend to all learning areas and key learning outcomes at each level (i.e., does
not narrow the curriculum)
c. Consist of tasks and tools that are fit for purpose
• be appropriate to the developmental level specific to the learning area
• be conducted in an authentic context
• promote the joy of learning through increase student engagement
d. Ensure that the assessment process is practical and efficient
• be contextualised and easy to use
• not take an excessive time through integration with teaching practices

FOUR-STAGE PROCESS
Across educational levels (primary, secondary and pre-university), teaching and assessment
approaches for Physical Education are largely similar. However, due to the differing needs of
students at each level, the types of assessment techniques and tools used may have slight
variations. Importantly, the 4-stage process of assessment remains the same throughout the
levels.
The assessment 4-stage process93 (refer Figure 7) outlines the main stages that teachers will
go through in the use of on-going assessments. Enactment of the 4-stage process is necessary
to ensure that the Assessment-Feedback-Learning loop is present in teaching and that the
feedback leads to addressing the gaps in students’ learning. The 4 stages are described in
detail below.
Stage 1 – Planning and communication of the learning intention(s) and success
criteria(s) of the lessons to students.
Stage 2 – Integrating the use of various on-going assessment strategies and/or tools as
part of the teaching. Then collecting and consolidating assessment
information.

93 Adapted from Saphier et al. (2008); Leong (2014)

225

Stage 3 – Analysing evidence of students’ learning. Using the assessment information
to provide feedback and for planning of interventions to progress learning.
Stage 4 – Sharing students’ attainment levels at the end of the term/semester/module.

Figure 7. The Assessment 4-Stage Process
Analysis of the assessment information allows teachers and students to identify gaps in
teaching and learning. Teachers use the assessment information to modify, adapt
instructional practices and/or differentiate lesson activities, where necessary, to create
appropriate learning experiences for students at various levels of progression. This presents
the opportunity for differentiated approach that may take the form of differentiated
instructions or differentiated learning tasks.
Students receive feedback on their learning from two sources. The first being from teachers.
The second and equally important source is the assessment information. This can come from
the knowledge of results or the knowledge of performance which is dependent on the
assessment task. The knowledge of results or performance provides students opportunity to
reflect on their strengths and work towards improving their weaker areas.

SHARING STUDENTS’ LEARNING ATTAINMENT
Primary 1 and 2: Holistic Development Profile
Students’ attainment at Primary 1 and 2 are shared via the Holistic Development Profile
(HDP). Specifically, HDP refers to the use of qualitative descriptors (QDs) for each HDP
learning outcome (HDP-LO) to report students’ learning progress. The use of HDP reporting
will be at the end of every Semester.

Table 21. Physical Education: Holistic Development Profile – Learning Outcomes
While the mandatory guidelines specifying that three to five HDP-LOs are reported each
semester, schools have the flexibility to decide on the following:
a. The three to five LOs per semester that will be reported.
• For PE, schools are provided with a list of subject-specific LOs that reflect the
syllabus outcomes for P1 and P2 respectively.
• Every LO must be reported at least once in a year, in either Semester 1 or 2, or in
both semesters.
b. Three or four levels of QDs to report students’ learning progress for each LO. Schools
are required to standardise the three or four level QDs across all P1 and P2 subjects.
• Schools can choose the QDs provided; or
• Schools can customise QDs.

Guidelines for Defining Qualitative Descriptors (QDs)
Schools can customise the definition of their QDs. Schools may be guided by the following
characteristics94 to differentiate QDs of the various levels (e.g., beginning, developing,
achieving).
•

Observable. Student attainment is described in terms of what is observed, rather than
what is not.

•

Clear. Users of the rubrics (e.g., teachers teaching different classes, students, and their
parents) understand what the descriptions mean.

•

Covers the whole range of performance. Descriptions of student attainment show a
progression of knowledge and/or skills across the levels for each criterion.

•

Distinguishes among levels. Descriptions of student attainment are sufficiently
differentiated from one level to another, and it is possible to match with examples of
student work at each level as agreed by the school or department.

•

Describes same aspects of work from level to level. Descriptions of student
attainment at each level describe different standards but for the same aspects of the
work.

To differentiate between the various QD levels (e.g., beginning, developing, achieving),
schools can consider unpacking them in terms of criteria that describe qualities which serve
as evidence of students’ learning. Some examples of differentiation are provided below.
Importantly, the various criteria listed are not exhaustive and should be defined in line with
the HDP-LOs with reference to the Physical Education syllabus. Notably, the assessment tools
found in this guide can help teachers establish the specific QD level of students.

94

•

Proficiency. Schools can assess students’ attainment level in terms of the level of
proficiency in which students are able to apply concepts and/or demonstrate skills.

•

Degree of Guidance Needed. Schools can assess students’ attainment level through
the degree of guidance needed for students to demonstrate their understanding of
the concepts and/or skills.

•

Numeric references. Schools can assess students’ attainment level in quantitative
terms using numeric references (e.g., demonstrate one/some/most/all the required
skills). As quantitative measures may not fully represent the attainment of learning
outcomes holistically, this criterion should preferably be used with other criteria that
describe students’ proficiency qualitatively (e.g., demonstrate the skill accurately).

•

Frequency. Schools can assess students’ attainment level based on the frequency with
which they demonstrate their understanding of the concepts and/or skills (and exhibit
values where relevant) as stipulated in the syllabuses. This criterion is often used for
assessing performance skills, behaviours and work habits, and similar to the use of
numeric references, it should be used together with other criteria that describe
students’ proficiency qualitatively to ensure holistic assessment.

From Primary 3 onwards
There is no mandatory reporting format for schools to adopt. Schools are encouraged to carry
on with their current practices for reporting students’ progress levels. Common reporting
approaches of schools include portfolios and progress reports/cards. For schools that choose
to report students’ progress levels by progress reports/cards, some have chosen to adopt a
reporting format that is similar to that of HDP. For these schools, they have defined
statements that best characterise the key learning intentions from across the learning areas.

GLOSSARY

The definitions provided are specific to the curriculum context in which the terms are used.
They are listed here in alphabetical order and is intended to be a source of quick reference.
Active
Engagement

Active engagement, specific to Outdoor Education, refers to observing and
interacting with the distinctive aspects of place(s) when moving around the
physical environment. As a result, students do not treat the environment
as a backdrop and deepen their understanding and/or develop their
attachment to place.

Adventure

Develop state of mind and emotional regulation when dealing a fluid
situation with some degree of uncertainty to the outcome and appreciate
the values and joy of adventurous experiences (Mortlock, 1984). This
broadens the current notion of adventure to promote lived experiences
and expeditions, de-emphasising activity-centric experiences. This forms
the core of Outdoor Education learning area framework.

Affective

Attitudes, values, feelings and social skills.

Affordances

What the environment provides for an individual – a perception of the
environment that provides “possibility for action” to an individual (Gibson,
1979).

Cognitive

The development of knowledge and thinking as related to the process.

Components of
health-related
physical fitness

Muscle strength, muscle endurance, aerobic capacity, flexibility, and body
composition.

Connectedness

The state of being connected and having a close relationship with other
things or people (Cambridge dictionary). Also see entry for connections.

Connections

Connections refer to the importance of deepening personal connections
(both cognitive and emotional) to what is being learned through
interactions with places and experiences (Demarest, 2015). This prompts
reflection on one’s interactions and connectedness with the environment
(both nature and urban) and its inhabitants (people, flora and fauna),
emphasising the importance of connectedness on community-building,
eco-literacy, and sustainability. This forms the core of Outdoor Education
learning area framework.

Environmental
cues

Natural or urban structures, signals and landmarks within the surrounding
that provides information on one’s location and elicit a response. In
Outdoor Education, students learn to use these cues for spatial orientation
based on their surroundings to locate their position, plot routes, and make
responsible decisions to explore places safely.

practices
Fundamental
motor skills

Common motor activities with observable outcomes.

Healthenhancing
physical activity

Health-enhancing physical activity is any form of physical activity that
benefits health and functional capacity without undue harm or risk.
Physical activity does not need to be strenuous to be effective. The choice
of activities is ample and includes brisk walking, doing housework, cycling,
gardening, swimming, dancing.

Health-related
fitness

Refers to the components of physical fitness that contribute to optimal
health. For the purposes of this document, the components are defined as
cardiovascular fitness, flexibility, muscular endurance, and muscular
strength. Body composition is a fifth component of health-related fitness.

Learning
experience

leaping, hopping, jumping, galloping, sliding, and skipping.

Manipulative
movements

Movements in which skills are developed while using an implement.
Examples include throwing, catching, punching, kicking, trapping, rolling,
dribbling, striking, and volleying.

Moderate-tovigorous
physical activity

The degree to which an activity is moderate-to-vigorous is directly related
to its ability to raise the heart rate, to improve cardiorespiratory fitness,
and to maintain this increase for a sustained period of time. Moderate-tovigorous physical activities are aerobic in nature, enhancing the health of
the heart and lungs, dependent on the frequency, intensity, time, and type
of activity.

Movement
competency

Sufficient ability, skill, and knowledge to meet the demands of a particular
physical activity.

231
OFFICIAL (CLOSED) / NON-SENSITIVE

Movement
concepts

The ideas used to modify or enrich the range and effectiveness of the skills
employed. They involve learning how, where, and with what the body
moves.

Movement
patterns

A series of individual movement skills linked together logically.

Movement
skills

These skills (stability, locomotion, and manipulation) are the foundation of
all physical activity and are essential both to an individual’s development
of effective motor skills and to the application of these skills in a wide
variety of physical activities.

Nature

Nature, in Singapore contexts, refers to any blue and green spaces (e.g., a
grass patch, canal, field), skyrise greenery, park connectors, parks, gardens,
wetlands, and nature parks/reserves.

Navigation

The science of locating the position and plotting the course of ships and
aircraft (Collins dictionary). Specific to Outdoor Education, students learn
to find their way around places by using various cues and reading a map.
They can locate their position, plot routes and make responsible decisions
to discover places safely.

Non-locomotor
movements

Movement that is organised around the axis of the body, including bending
and stretching, pushing and pulling, raising and lowering, twisting and
turning, shaking, bouncing, circling, and swinging.

Outdoors

Any open-air, wild, natural, or human-made Space (Lee et al., 2022)
Nuances: The space may include a temporary or fixed cover (e.g., awning
or roof) but maintain exposure to ambient environmental conditions

Outdoor
competencies

Key knowledge, skills and attitudes related to the content (i.e., 3 strands)
of Outdoor Education learning area that enable students to enjoy the
outdoors in a safe, responsible, and sustainable way.

Outdoor living

Knowledge, skills, and attitudes (often related to technical competencies,
see entry) necessary for an individual to feel confident and act comfortably
in the outdoors.

Outcome

A syllabus outcome expresses a specific intended result of the teaching of
the syllabus. Outcomes are derived from the content of the syllabus and
are arranged in stages. They provide clear statements of the knowledge,
skills and understandings expected to be gained by most students as a
result of effective teaching and learning.

Pedagogical
Focus
(plural: foci)

Pedagogical focus refers to one of the five main elements that guides
teachers in the design and delivery of learning experiences to achieve the
place-responsive pedagogical intent of building personal connections with
places.

Physical Fitness

Physical fitness refers to the ability of the body systems to work together
efficiently to allow one to be healthy and perform activities of daily living.

Physical Health

Physical health is the well-being of the body and the proper functioning of
the organism of individuals, which is a normal condition of individuals of
both physical, and mental condition and are not suffering from any type of
sickness (TheWorldBook.org). A person who has good physical health is
likely to have bodily functions and processes working at their peak. Regular
exercise, balanced nutrition and adequate rest contribute to good health.

Problem solving

A game/modified game or situation that allows students to practice a skill
theme/games/outdoor concept while dealing with a ‘problem’ or
challenge.

Qualities of
movement

Attributes of a movement skill that contribute to its efficiency or aesthetic
appeal. Examples of qualities of movement include speed, force, time or
speed, and flow.

Resilience

Resilience refers to building resilience-related competencies to adapt, cope
and manage during physical and socio-emotional challenges and
understand the possibility to bounce back from adversity. This forms the
core of Outdoor Education learning area framework.

School-based
assessment

School-based assessment is assessment that is designed, conducted and
graded by schools.

Self-Care

Self-care is the practice of taking action to preserve or improve one’s own
health (Oxford Dictionary). The World Health Organisation defines selfcare as the ability of individuals, families, communities to promote health,
prevent disease, maintain heath and to cope with illness and disability with
or without the support of a healthcare provider.

Sense of Place

Sense of place is defined as the attachment between people and places
and the symbolic meanings they ascribe to places (Kudryavtsev et al.,
2012).

Sensory Cues

Visual, tactual, olfactory, gustatory, and/or auditory stimuli that evoke a
response or a behaviour pattern (APA dictionary of Psychology). In Outdoor
Education, students learn to use these cues based on the understanding
that real world experiences engage all our senses so we can elicit meaning
and emotions to learn and draw connections.
