PREAMBLE: Physical Education and Sports Development Framework
The Physical Education and Sports Development Framework guides the delivery of Physical Education and sports within the school system. It envisions a nation of active, healthy and physically competent individuals. Everyone values, participates, and pursues physical activities, including outdoor activities and sports of their interest and ability, in order to enrich their lives, be they for recreation and well-being, personal challenge and achievement, or for national honours.

Fundamental motor skills and core values provide a strong foundation for the learning, safe participation and enjoyment of a wide variety of physical activities. With a broad-based development of physical competencies, everyone is able to continue participating at a recreational level. Those with the interest and ability to participate at a higher level will be able to specialise and commit to sport-specific training. Individuals who demonstrate talent can then invest their time and effort in training for high performance with the national sports organisations.

The physical ability and interest of each person may change across the life span. With a broad range of physical competencies, each individual is enabled at any level of participation to choose and switch to the physical activities and sports preferred. These individuals are able to continue their participation recreationally or competitively, thus motivating them towards lifelong participation.

The school’s Physical Education curriculum is a primary contributor to building a strong foundation for the development of broad-based physical competencies and opportunities for recreational participation. Building upon the Physical Education curriculum, the Physical Sports Co-curricular Activities (CCA) programme provides opportunities for specialisation in a sport, as well as broad-based development within the specialised sport and across other sports. Together with other school programmes, Physical Education, Outdoor Education, and Physical Sports CCA contribute to holistic education and the development of 21st Century Competencies to better prepare each individual to thrive in a fast-changing and highly connected world.

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Curriculum Framework
Physical Education is an integral component of Singapore’s school curriculum to develop students holistically. By emphasising the importance of movement, and an individual’s interaction with the environment, Physical Education seeks to develop the whole child to bring about a nation of physically competent and confident individuals who enjoy a lifetime of active and healthy living safely and responsibly.

The three learning areas of Physical Activity, Outdoor Education, and Physical Health and Safety are pivotal in providing the content for design and enactment of students’ meaningful learning experiences in, about and through movement. These areas leverage the physical and social environment to provide real-life contexts that strengthen students’ learning. A balanced and well-designed Physical Education curriculum, delivered through effective pedagogies and purposeful assessment can enable students to apply the skills, knowledge, practices and values to lead an active and healthy lifestyle. Additionally, it can help them acquire the 21st century competencies to thrive in the fast changing and complex world.

Philosophical Underpinnings The Physical Education syllabus is underpinned by the belief that movement is fundamental and essential to life, work and play. All individuals have the capacity to capitalise on their movement potential to lead productive and fulfilling lives. Developing movement competence is an integral part of an individual’s holistic education. It facilitates participation in physical activities through which the individual discovers the joy of movement, learns about themselves and their bodies, and develops the physical, cognitive and affective competencies that will contribute to their lifelong well-being.

The premise of a healthy lifestyle includes regular physical activity participation. It is essential for healthy growth and development in children and adolescents and is associated with lifelong health benefits and quality of life. Regular participation in a range of physical activities and intensity levels is necessary to achieve substantive health benefits.

An individual’s development and lifestyle behaviours are shaped by their interactions with the environment. Therefore, meaningful and authentic learning experiences in school prepare the individual to contribute to the community and adapt to different life contexts. The Physical Education syllabus recognises the importance of providing students with real-life contexts that strengthen their learning and enable them to apply the skills, knowledge, practices and values to lead an active and healthy lifestyle.

Big Ideas Physical Education uses movement and the environment to develop the whole child.

Movement: Movement is fundamental to Physical Education. It is used as a means to facilitate students’ holistic development through three interconnected dimensions:

Learning in Movement: Involves developing movement competencies and appreciating the inherent values and joy of movement experiences. Successful participation requires the acquisition and mastery of appropriate fundamental and specialised skills.

Learning about Movement: Involves pursuing knowledge and understanding about movement. Students develop an understanding of their body, how it moves and how to improve their movement, health, and fitness safely.

Learning through Movement: Involves leveraging movement experiences to develop desirable personal and social attributes, such as character, social-emotional competencies, fitness and mental well-being.

Interaction with Environment: The environment plays a crucial role in shaping and reinforcing movement competence and lifestyle behaviours.

Physical Environment: Includes physical structures and the natural world (e.g., sports facilities, nature, outdoor spaces). Use of nature promotes connectedness and well-being.

Social Environment: Includes the immediate social setting (friends, teachers, family). Friends provide a supportive environment for co-constructing knowledge; teachers serve as role models; parents reinforce learning at home; community partners provide expertise.

Purpose and Goals The purpose of Physical Education is to develop physically competent and confident individuals who enjoy a lifetime of active and healthy living safely and responsibly. The five goals are:

Movement Competence: Students are competent and confident to participate in a range of physical and outdoor activities.

Healthy Lifestyle Practices: Students have a personal commitment to healthy lifestyle practices in physical activity, nutrition, sleep, outdoor time and hygiene.

Safety Mindset: Students apply risk assessment to manage daily and physical activities with respect to self, others and the environment.

Core Values: Students make informed and responsible decisions with regard to personal behaviour and social interactions based on sound values-based judgements (Respect, Resilience, Responsibility, Integrity, Care, Harmony).

Enjoyment: Students enjoy and value physical activities and healthy living in a sustainable way.

1.2 Syllabus Design

Pedagogy and Assessment The teaching of Physical Education primarily adopts an applied learning instructional approach. Key features include:

Experience: Rich opportunities to explore and apply skills in authentic contexts.

Collaboration: Working together to co-construct knowledge.

Inquiry: Critical thinking and reflection to influence decision-making.

Integration: Connecting content across topics for transferability.

Differentiation: Accommodating diverse learning needs. Assessment provides information for making informed judgements about student progress and helps students monitor their own learning.

1.3 Desired Outcomes and 21st Century Competencies
Physical Education anchors learning on six core values: Respect, Resilience, Responsibility, Integrity, Care, and Harmony. These are linked to Social-Emotional Competencies and emerging 21st Century Competencies (Critical, Adaptive and Inventive Thinking; Communication, Collaboration and Information Skills). For example, dance and gymnastics allow students to tap on creativity; sports and outdoor adventure require problem-solving and collaboration.
